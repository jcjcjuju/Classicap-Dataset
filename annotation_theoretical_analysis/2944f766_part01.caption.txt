This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, spans a compressed seven-bar structure derived from an eight-bar sentence through phrase overlap at the fourth bar. It is immediately followed—without pause—by a bridge-passage or transition that overlaps the conclusion of the first subject; this transitional section remains entirely within the tonic key and culminates in a half-cadence. The second subject then appears in the dominant key (A major) and is divided into two distinct subsections, each closed by a perfect cadence. The initial subsection (Bars 16–24) comprises an eight-bar sentence formed from two four-bar phrases, with the latter phrase constituting a modified repetition of the former, adjusted to achieve a full cadence rather than a half-cadence. The subsequent subsection (Bars 24–36) begins with a four-bar ostinato-like motive introduced in the left hand, which is reiterated at varying pitch levels; at the third repetition, the parts undergo inversion, only to be re-inverted through voice crossing in the following bar. The principal portion of this subsection (Bars 28–36) unfolds as a two-bar periodic melody in which all four phrases commence identically with the same three-note motif, and the latter pair of phrases replicates the former pair. A codetta follows (Bars 36–39), constructed from the slurred quaver figure first heard in Bar 29; this codetta serves as the primary motivic source for the opening eighteen bars of the development section. The exposition concludes with a double bar and repeat sign.
