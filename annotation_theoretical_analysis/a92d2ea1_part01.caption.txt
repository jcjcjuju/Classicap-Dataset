This constitutes the first part of a simple binary form, functioning as the initial structural division of the movement. It opens with a first subject in the tonic key of F major, which modulates to and concludes in the dominant key of C major; this thematic statement is subsequently repeated in its entirety. Following the repeat, a brief coda ensues, reaffirming the tonic key through the restatement of the closing material from the first subject—an octave higher—and its further reiteration in F major. A development section follows, initiating with imitative treatment of a motivic figure derived from the second and third bars of the first subject. At its midpoint, a new contrapuntal idea is introduced and imitated in the bass, after which the remainder of the development draws exclusively upon referential material from the first subject. The first subject then reappears, though only its latter portion is presented, varied and sustained over a dominant pedal. A final coda concludes the part, commencing with energetic imitative counterpoint based on the fifth bar of the first subject, incorporating passages in contrary motion, and culminating in a transposition of the first subject’s original closing phrase—now rendered in the tonic key rather than the dominant.
