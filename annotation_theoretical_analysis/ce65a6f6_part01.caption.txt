This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of E major, concluding with a cadential articulation that is subsequently prolonged through a varied reiteration of its closing gesture. The second subject departs from the conventional dominant key, unfolding instead through a tonal trajectory that begins in E minor and modulates to G major; this section is bipartite, with the first segment establishing E minor and cadencing in G major, and the second segment remaining in G major. This is followed by a developmental passage that elaborates motivic material from the first segment of the second subject, succeeded by a varied repetition of the second segment. The exposition concludes with a restatement of the first subject in its original tonic key of E major.
