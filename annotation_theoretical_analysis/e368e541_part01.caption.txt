This constitutes the exposition of a tonal fugue in C major. The subject is first presented in the alto voice in the tonic key. A tonal answer follows in the treble voice, transposed to the dominant key of G major, with no counter-subject accompanying either entry. The subject then reappears in the bass voice, firmly reestablishing the tonic key of C major. The tonal answer exhibits the conventional alteration from the third to the fourth scale degree to preserve tonal stability, characteristic of a tonal fugue.
