This constitutes the first large-scale section of an extended ternary (ABABA) form in B minor, characterized by dramatic intensity and agitated expression. It opens with a brief introduction featuring two forceful chords: an inversion of the supertonic half-diminished seventh and the dominant seventh. The primary thematic material (A) begins with the main theme in B minor, underpinned by a tonic pedal, followed by a transposition of the theme to E minor over a dominant pedal. The subsequent passage returns firmly to B minor, sustaining a dominant pedal while employing frequent diminished seventh chords and chromatic nonharmonic tones—such as E♯ and G♯—without effecting modulation. A contrasting interlude ensues, marked by dynamic contrasts between soft textures and sudden loud outbursts, remaining entirely within B minor and concluding with a perfect cadence. The B section ("Agitato") initiates with a sequential treatment of the main theme’s rhythmic and figural motives, progressing through a series of tonal centers via the iv–V⁷–I progression in D major, F♯ minor, and A major. This is succeeded by another sequence incorporating a French augmented sixth chord and dominant harmonies that modulate through C♯ minor, C minor, and ultimately resolve to B minor. The music then settles into F♯ major (the dominant major), where it features a flattened sixth scale degree (D♮) and confirms the key with perfect cadences. A return to B minor follows, supported by a dominant pedal and enriched with chromatic inflections, culminating in a dominant ninth chord. The remainder of the section unfolds as a passage based on arpeggiated diminished seventh chords. The A section recurs with the full statement of the main theme in its original form, followed by a restatement of the interlude. The B section is then repeated identically in its agitated character. A final recurrence of the A section presents the main theme once more, succeeded by a modified and extended interlude that diverges from its earlier iterations by concluding on the dominant rather than resolving with a perfect cadence.
