This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of D minor, though its second portion is omitted, resulting in a truncated statement. A reworked connecting episode follows, initially altered in its first half before modulating not to the dominant but to B flat major, a key foreign to the tonic’s conventional tonal orbit. The second subject then appears in the tonic key of D minor rather than in a contrasting key, fulfilling the harmonic resolution typical of recapitulatory procedure. The movement concludes with an extensively recomposed coda: the opening two bars of the first subject are presented in the bass, paired with a semiquaver figuration in the treble. This gives way to a chromatic ascent in the bass from A natural to its upper octave, deliberately omitting F sharp, while the harmonic language becomes saturated with diminished seventh chords. The coda culminates over a dominant pedal on A, interspersed with faint motivic echoes of the first subject, thereby reinforcing tonal closure through both harmonic and thematic means.
