This constitutes the exposition of a prelude structured in four distinct periods, each delineated by cadential closure and thematic differentiation. Period I establishes the primary thematic material, culminating in a perfect cadence in the dominant key of F♯ major. Period II introduces a new thematic idea presented in sequence, initially in the dominant key, and modulates through G♯ minor and F♯ major before achieving a perfect cadence in the tonic key of B major. Period III initiates with a third thematic figure and engages in a series of modulations—touching G♯ minor, A♯ minor, D♯ minor, and C♯ minor—while functionally orienting toward the dominant, ultimately concluding on an F♯ dominant pedal point. Period IV commences with the continuation of the dominant pedal and resolves with a perfect cadence in the tonic key of B major, incorporating a modified restatement of the opening thematic material. Throughout, a third voice is intermittently added to enrich harmonic texture, particularly during transitional spans.
