This constitutes the introduction to a sonata-form movement. The passage is rooted in G minor but exhibits tonal ambiguity through the initial omission of the tonic triad. It opens with an arpeggiated Neapolitan sixth chord (C–E♭–A♭), presented in unison octaves across both hands, and incorporates a lower neighbour note, B♭, which together form a motivic cell (B♭–C–A♭) later transposed in the second theme. The harmonic language remains unstable through Bars 6–7, where chordal textures employ inversions of subdominant (iv) and submediant seventh (VI⁷) harmonies. The final harmony places the dominant scale degree in the bass, functioning as a dominant preparation that resolves to a dominant seventh chord at the onset of the subsequent Moderato section.
