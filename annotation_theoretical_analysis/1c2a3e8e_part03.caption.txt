This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of A major, though it is both shortened and altered relative to its initial presentation; specifically, the passage corresponding to the original closing phrase is replaced by a repetition of a two-bar motif, which is extended to three bars and presented first in D major before resolving into the tonic A major, thereby concluding the first subject. The connecting episode follows, significantly modified from its exposition counterpart in order to modulate not to the dominant but to the tonic minor. The second subject then appears transposed to begin in A minor and ultimately concludes in A major, maintaining close fidelity to its original form with only minimal alterations, as evidenced by the near-identical correspondence between its closing phrases and those of the exposition. Finally, the coda returns in the tonic key, preserving the essential material of the earlier coda but featuring a modified bass line in its latter portion.
