This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of E-flat major and is divisible into two contrasting parts: the initial phrase concludes with a full cadence in the tonic and is immediately restated, while the subsequent phrase, though differing markedly in character, also begins and ends in the tonic key. A connecting episode follows, initiating with material derived from the latter portion of the first subject, transposed into the tonic minor, and proceeding with new thematic content that modulates to the dominant key, in which it concludes. The second subject then appears in the dominant key of B-flat major, constructed predominantly upon the common chord of that key and rhythmically modeled after the second part of the first subject. The exposition closes with an extended dominant seventh chord that functions as a structural dominant preparation, facilitating both the repeat of the exposition and the subsequent transition into the development section.
