This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of G major, preserving its original tonal and structural identity. It is followed by a connecting episode that retains the length and thematic material of its expositional counterpart but is reworked harmonically to modulate not to the dominant but to D major, thereby preparing for the tonic-key return of the second subject. The second subject then appears transposed to the tonic key of G major, fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of sonata-form recapitulations. A transitional passage follows, initially designed to lead to a repeat of the development and recapitulation; in its alternative function, it is modified by the omission of its latter portion and extended with additional material to effect a transition into the coda. The coda itself is constructed from motivic reminiscences of the first subject, specifically presenting its initial four-bar idea twice in the bass and subsequently restating it in the treble at a pitch level a semitone higher.
