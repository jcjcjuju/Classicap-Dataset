This constitutes the final thematic return and coda of a rounded binary or sonata-rondo structure. The principle subject appears in its third and final statement, presented in the tonic key with its characteristic eight-bar sentence structure, comprising two four-bar phrases wherein the second phrase concludes with a full cadence. This is followed by a coda that synthesizes motivic material from earlier sections: specifically, it combines semiquaver (sixteenth note) figures derived from both the second link and the first episode, thereby unifying the movement’s thematic content through developmental variation in its concluding passage.
