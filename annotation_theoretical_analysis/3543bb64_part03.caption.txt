This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of F minor, presented without alteration. It is followed by a connecting episode that closely mirrors its counterpart from the exposition, though transposed to modulate toward the tonic rather than the dominant, thereby fulfilling the structural requirement of tonal resolution in the recapitulation. The second subject then appears, now transposed to the tonic key of F minor and slightly varied in its presentation, maintaining its internal bipartite structure with both thematic segments concluding with full cadences. The movement concludes with a coda derived entirely from a varied restatement of the opening gesture of the first subject.
