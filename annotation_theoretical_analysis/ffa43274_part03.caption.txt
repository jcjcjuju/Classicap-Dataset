This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject theme returns in the subdominant key of D major, maintaining its lyrical character. The subsequent transition is transposed up a perfect fourth relative to its appearance in the exposition, facilitating a realignment of tonal trajectory. The second subject follows, also transposed up a perfect fourth from its original dominant-key presentation, thereby now residing in the tonic key of A major, fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of sonata-form recapitulations.
