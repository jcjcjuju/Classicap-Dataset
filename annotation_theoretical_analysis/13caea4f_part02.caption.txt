This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. It begins with a rhythmic transformation of the first subject theme, now presented over a triplet accompaniment and transposed to G major, the subdominant key. The thematic material undergoes reworking through this altered rhythmic and harmonic context. By the midpoint of the section, the music returns to the tonic key of D major. This reestablishment of the tonic is reinforced by the appearance of an Italian augmented sixth chord in two distinct statements, which function to intensify harmonic tension and drive toward dominant preparation. The section concludes with a sustained dominant pedal, prolonging the dominant harmony and creating a harmonic suspension that anticipates the impending recapitulation.
