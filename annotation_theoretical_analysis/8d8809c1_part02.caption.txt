This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The material is derived from the first subject, subjected to sequential and contrapuntal treatment. An initial sequential passage begins in B flat minor and F minor, followed by a corresponding sequence starting on the chord of A flat minor and modulating to E flat major. This is succeeded by an eight-bar passage featuring inversion of parts, based on the opening motive of the first subject, which traverses a modulating sequence through A flat major, B flat minor, and ultimately to C minor. Within this tonal trajectory, an Italian sixth chord appears in C minor. The section concludes with a harmonic resolution in its final bar: the dominant chord of C minor (the relative minor of the tonic) resolves to an inversion of the dominant seventh chord in E flat major, thereby preparing the return to the tonic key at the onset of the recapitulation.
