This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. It begins with a passage derived from the first subject, initiating in C major and concluding with a perfect cadence in the tonic minor. This is followed by an extended episode based on motivic material drawn from the opening figure of the transition, consistently accompanied by triplet semiquavers. The episode commences in C minor and proceeds through a series of modulations: to G minor, then to D minor, where, at a structural juncture, the contrapuntal parts undergo inversion. The harmonic trajectory continues with incidental references to F major, a return to D minor, followed by C minor and G minor, ultimately arriving at F major. In this final key area, the inverted parts are re-inverted, and the section concludes on a half-cadence. Notable harmonic events include a German sixth chord in D minor and a chromatic supertonic chord with a minor ninth.
