This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of D major, presented without transposition or significant alteration. It is followed by a connecting episode that initially replicates the exposition’s opening material verbatim but diverges harmonically by concluding in A major rather than the dominant of the dominant (E major). The subsequent portions of the connecting episode correspond exactly to the second and third segments of the original episode, transposed up a perfect fourth to ensure a final cadence in the tonic key of D major rather than the dominant. The second subject then appears entirely in the tonic key of D major, fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of sonata-form recapitulations. A brief transitional passage follows, leading directly into the coda. The coda is constructed over a sustained tonic pedal point and incorporates motivic material derived from the first subject, thereby reinforcing thematic unity and tonal stability at the movement’s close.
