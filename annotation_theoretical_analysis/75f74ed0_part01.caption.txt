This constitutes the exposition, modulatory, and recapitulatory sections of a tonal fugue in B major. The exposition presents the subject in the tenor in the tonic key, followed by a tonal answer in the alto in the dominant (F♯ major), accompanied by a countersubject in the tenor. The subject then appears in the treble in the tonic, with the countersubject in the alto; this is succeeded by an answer in the bass in the dominant, paired with the countersubject in the treble. A codetta, loosely derived from the initial portion of the countersubject, leads to a final statement of the subject in the tenor in the tonic. The modulatory section commences with Episode I, which modulates from B major to F♯ major; this is followed by a statement of the subject in the alto in the dominant, concluding with a cadence in F♯ major. The subject then appears in inversion in the treble in F♯ major, answered by its inversion in the alto in the same key. A return to the tonic occurs with the subject in the bass in B major, succeeded by an answer in the tenor that cadences in C♯ minor. Episode II then modulates from C♯ minor back to B major. The recapitulatory section begins with the subject in the alto in the tonic, followed by the answer in the treble in the dominant, accompanied by the countersubject in the alto. The movement concludes with a coda in B major, which includes reminiscences of the opening notes of the countersubject in the tenor.
