This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of D minor and is framed by dominant harmony at both its beginning and conclusion; its initial two bars, marked “Largo,” introduce a motivic idea of structural significance throughout the movement. This is followed by a connecting episode that initially continues the material of the first subject, culminating in a full cadence in the tonic key. Subsequently, a new thematic idea in D minor is introduced, whose opening four-note figure derives from the Largo motive of the first subject; this figure is then reiterated in the bass, transposed sequentially over a stepwise ascending bass line from D to E, thereby preparing the dominant of the second subject’s key. The second subject appears in A minor—the minor dominant rather than the relative major—and is bipartite in structure. The rhythmic character of its first segment recalls the “Allegro” portion of the first subject. A coda follows, developed directly from material of the second subject. The exposition concludes with a brief transitional passage leading to its repeat, followed by a further connecting passage that links the exposition to the development section.
