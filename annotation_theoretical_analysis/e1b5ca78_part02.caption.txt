This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with a fragment of the first subject transposed to F major. Subsequently, there is a brief allusion to the second subject, followed by another excerpt of the first subject, now presented in C major. A new motivic figure is then introduced, which undergoes brief elaboration before giving way to scalar passagework. The entire development culminates with a resolution into the tonic key of A flat major.
