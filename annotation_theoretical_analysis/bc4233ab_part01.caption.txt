This constitutes the Menuetto section of a ternary-form movement, functioning as the initial structural division. It presents a binary construction within the tonic key of E♭ major. The first subject establishes the tonic and concludes with a half cadence on the dominant harmony. Following a brief elision or transition, the second subject ensues, derived motivically from the first subject and remaining firmly within the tonic key of E♭ major. The section concludes with a double bar and is followed by a repeat instruction that encompasses the second subject and its continuation, thereby reinforcing the thematic material through literal repetition.
