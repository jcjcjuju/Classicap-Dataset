This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. It opens with an introduction in C sharp minor, presenting an agitated theme characterized by a chromatically descending sequence. The first subject follows, firmly rooted in C sharp minor, and undergoes a series of modulations: to E major, then to F sharp minor, subsequently to B major, and finally to A flat major. The second subject appears in D flat major—the enharmonic equivalent of the tonic C sharp minor—and adopts a slower, chorale-like character. This section modulates to G flat major, the subdominant of D flat major. The exposition concludes with a passage that presents the second subject’s opening phrase with its melody transposed to a higher octave.
