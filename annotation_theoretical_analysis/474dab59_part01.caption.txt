This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of A major, unfolding through a series of four-bar phrases: an initial phrase concludes with a half cadence on the dominant, followed by a second phrase achieving a perfect authentic cadence on the dominant. This is succeeded by a four-bar passage over a dominant pedal point, after which a final four-bar phrase—structurally analogous to the opening phrase but modified—resolves conclusively in the tonic key. An episode follows, introducing new thematic material in the tonic before modulating to the dominant key, E major, where it concludes. The second subject then appears in E major, beginning with a two-bar phrase that is immediately repeated twice with variation. A sequential passage ensues, culminating in an inverted dominant pedal point that prepares for the return of the first subject in the tonic. This return features the first subject once again in A major, now varied at each recurrence.
