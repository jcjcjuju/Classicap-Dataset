This constitutes a varied restatement of the movement’s initial binary form, functioning as a modified recapitulation. The section begins with a return of the first subject in the tonic key of F minor, now transformed through pervasive syncopation in its melodic presentation. A subsequent sequential passage follows, maintaining structural correspondence with its earlier iteration while incorporating rhythmic and textural alterations. The reprise of the first subject in the tonic is again adjusted to confirm F minor conclusively. An episode features a bass line articulated in continuous quavers (eighth notes), contrasting with the original texture, before the coda reaffirms the tonic key. Throughout, the material adheres to the formal outline of the First Part but is significantly reworked through rhythmic displacement and textural variation.
