This constitutes the development section of the movement. It commences with the third subject in C minor, which subsequently modulates to G minor; this G-minor passage is presented as a literal repetition of its preceding eight-bar span. Following this repetition, the music modulates further to F minor before ultimately arriving at a cadence in E flat major. The section concludes with a transitional passage that closely resembles the earlier dominant-pedal passage leading from the dominant key back to the tonic, here adapted to prepare the return of the tonic key.
