This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The material is principally derived from two sources: the thematic content of the coda from the exposition and the opening rhythmic-melodic figure of the first subject. The developmental treatment exploits these motives through fragmentation, sequential manipulation, and harmonic recontextualization across various tonal areas. The section culminates in a sustained harmonic drive toward the dominant seventh chord, establishing a clear dominant-function preparation for the impending recapitulation.
