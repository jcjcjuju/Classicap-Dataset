This constitutes the final thematic statement and coda of a rondo-like structure. The principal subject returns in its third iteration, now elaborated with increasingly florid ornamentation that enhances its melodic profile while preserving its fundamental sentence construction. Following this, the coda commences, synthesizing motivic material derived from both the principal subject and the first episode. It culminates in a transposed restatement of the closing phrase of the first episode, firmly reestablished in the tonic key, thereby providing a cohesive and conclusive termination to the movement.
