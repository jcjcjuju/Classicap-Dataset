This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. It commences with a striking transposition of the first phrase of the first subject into the key of the dominant minor, immediately followed by a passage derived motivically from the same phrase. This latter passage initiates a series of transient modulations, first moving through C major and then, via the chromatic dominant seventh chord of F major, progressing through B flat minor to B flat major. In this latter key, an episode ensues—a structural feature atypical of classical developments yet characteristic of Mozart’s practice. Following the episode, a transitional passage modulates through G minor to F minor, where a brief allusion to the second section of the second subject appears. The section concludes with four bars emphasizing dominant harmony on C, succeeded by a virtuosic passage constructed from inverted figures originating in the original transition, which functions as a retransition leading into the recapitulation.
