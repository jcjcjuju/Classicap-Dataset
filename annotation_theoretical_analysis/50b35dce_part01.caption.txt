This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of G minor and spans an eight-bar phrase, concluding with a half-cadence on the dominant. A connecting episode follows, initiating with a literal quotation of the first four bars of the first subject before modulating to F major—the dominant of the relative major (B♭ major). The second subject then unfolds in B♭ major, beginning with a two-bar phrase that is immediately repeated at the octave higher; this pattern recurs once more, establishing a sequential design. At the onset of the third iteration, the two-bar idea overlaps with the start of a new four-bar phrase, which itself is subsequently repeated in a varied and extended form. The exposition concludes with a coda derived motivically from the opening of the second subject. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
