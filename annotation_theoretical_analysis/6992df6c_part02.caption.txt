This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. Following a two-bar introductory passage, the section is entirely devoted to motivic treatment of the first part of the first subject, which originally appeared in the tonic key of A flat major. The developmental process commences in F minor, initiating a recontextualization of the thematic material through tonal displacement. The texture and character of this segment reflect the developmental function, with the thematic fragment subjected to sequential or contrapuntal manipulation within the new harmonic environment.
