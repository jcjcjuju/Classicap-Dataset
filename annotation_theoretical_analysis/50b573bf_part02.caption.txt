This constitutes the development section of a sonata-form movement. The passage is an episode in F sharp minor, characterized by a chromatically descending bass line. It culminates in a half-cadence in F sharp minor, articulated through a progression involving augmented sixth chords: specifically, a German sixth chord transforms into an Italian sixth chord, which then resolves to the dominant harmony of F sharp minor.
