This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in C minor. The exposition presents the subject in the alto in the tonic key of C minor, followed by a tonal answer in the treble in G minor, without a counter-subject. A codetta modulates from G minor back to C minor. The subject reappears in the tenor in C minor, succeeded by an extended codetta that modulates through G minor and F minor before returning to C minor. The exposition concludes with an answer in the bass in C minor, followed by a statement of the subject in the treble in C minor and an answer in the alto whose key is unspecified but contextually implies a continuation within the tonic or closely related tonal area.  

The modulatory section commences with the subject in the bass in F minor. Subsequently, the subject returns in the treble in C minor, initiating Stretto I, wherein the alto presents the subject in augmentation in C minor. The tenor enters with the answer by free imitation in C minor, followed by an answer in the alto in G minor and a simultaneous statement of the subject in the treble in G minor. The tenor then states the subject in C minor while the treble presents the answer in A-flat major. Later, the bass states the subject in augmentation in C minor, concurrently with the treble presenting the subject by inversion in C minor. This is followed by the bass stating the answer by inversion in C minor, and finally a straightforward statement of the subject in the bass in C minor.  

The recapitulatory section opens with Stretto II, in which the alto presents the subject in C minor, immediately imitated by the treble with the answer in C minor. The treble then states the subject in F minor, followed by the tenor presenting the subject in F minor while the bass simultaneously offers the answer by free inversion in C minor. The section concludes with a coda.
