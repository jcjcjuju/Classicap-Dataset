This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key, beginning with a unison phrase followed by a second phrase extended to five bars through internal repetition. This subject concludes with a descending melodic sequence articulated in semiquaver (sixteenth note) figures, culminating in a perfect cadence in the tonic. The transition overlaps the first subject, commencing with a tonic pedal sustained over four bars and proceeding through a brief modulation to G major before reaffirming the tonic key; it ultimately arrives at a half-cadence, featuring an augmented sixth chord in D major at its structural apex. The second subject unfolds in the dominant key (A major) and is partitioned into two distinct sections. The initial section opens with a four-bar phrase concluding on an inverted cadence, which is then restated in modified form; this is succeeded by a five-bar phrase characterized by a sequential ascent in its first three bars and terminating in a half cadence, followed by a final phrase sustained over a dominant pedal. The subsequent section initiates with a phrase that, though inherently four bars in design, is compressed to three through immediate overlapping repetition; its responsive phrase is expanded via sequential repetition and a cadential extension, thereby achieving structural balance through compensatory phrase manipulation. The entire exposition is marked for literal repetition.
