This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage is predominantly derived from the opening motive of the first subject, with the exception of a brief episode that reproduces a segment of the transition’s melody in F minor. The section commences with the opening motive presented over a C major chord, which functions as the dominant of F minor, thereby initiating a modulation to that key. Subsequently, a modulation to G minor occurs, accompanied by an inversion of the parts, followed by a further modulation to C minor. The development concludes with an inversion of the dominant ninth chord.
