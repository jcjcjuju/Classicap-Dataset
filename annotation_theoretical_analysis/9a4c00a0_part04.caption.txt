This constitutes the recapitulatory and coda sections of a hybrid formal structure that integrates fugal and rondo procedures. The first subject reappears in D major, presented in the bass and slightly shortened; it is subsequently answered by inversion in G major, followed by a further inverted and slightly altered statement in an inner voice. An episode derived primarily from the subject ensues, culminating on an A major chord, and is succeeded by a new imitatory episode in D major. The subject then returns in the tonic key of B flat major, again in shortened form and distributed across various voices, now combined contrapuntally with material from the earlier episode. This is followed by a dual answer in the dominant key: an inverted version in the bass and a direct statement in the treble, both occurring simultaneously. Further entries of the subject occur at the same structural point—Bar 290—with inversion in the treble and direct form in the bass. The remainder of this section is densely saturated with imitative treatments of previously introduced material, employing virtually every standard contrapuntal device. The movement concludes with a coda characterized by a pedal point that initiates on the subdominant (E flat), shifts to the dominant (F), and then incorporates a tonic pedal to form a double pedal point. Throughout the coda, thematic content is drawn exclusively from the first subject and its associated counter-subject, culminating in a full cadence in the tonic key.
