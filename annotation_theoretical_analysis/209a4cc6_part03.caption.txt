This constitutes a literal reprise of the First Part in its entirety, thereby reaffirming the initial formal and tonal design. It opens with the first subject in E-flat major, which begins on the dominant harmony and concludes in the tonic key of A-flat major; this phrase is followed by its varied repetition. An episode ensues, constructed as an eight-bar sequence derived from the first subject, leading to a restatement of the first subject in varied form—first presented in the bass with a running quaver accompaniment in the treble, then transferred to the treble with the accompaniment shifting to the bass. The section concludes with a coda, completing the reprise of the original binary structure.
