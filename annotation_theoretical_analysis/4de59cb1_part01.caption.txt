This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The principal subject is introduced as a seven-bar sentence in the tonic key, exhibiting an elision of a bar in its first half; the notation suggests a metrical discrepancy, as the phrase appears more coherently structured when each notated bar is interpreted as two bars in a duple meter, thereby aligning cadences with metrically normative positions. Following this, Episode I unfolds in B flat major—the dominant—featuring a melodic sentence prolonged through cadential repetition. This episode concludes with a harmonic link on the dominant of E flat major, commencing with the fourth inversion of the dominant eleventh chord; within this progression, the major ninth resolves to the minor ninth before both the ninth and eleventh resolve, leaving the root-position dominant seventh chord to prepare the return of the principal subject. The principal subject then reappears in a varied form, enriched with ornamentation, while retaining its essential thematic identity.
