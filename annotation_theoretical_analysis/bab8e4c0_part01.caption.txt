This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The section opens with an Introduction featuring the third inversion of the dominant minor ninth chord, which is reiterated thirteen times before a scalar passage resolves deceptively onto the tonic at the onset of the first subject. The first subject is presented in F minor (the tonic key) and is bipartite in structure: the initial phrase establishes and concludes in the tonic, followed by a varied repetition with altered bass voice; the second phrase likewise begins and ends in the tonic and is subsequently repeated with variation. A connecting episode follows, derived motivically from the opening two bars of the first subject, underpinned harmonically by the tonic chord, then the dominant of C minor, and finally the C minor chord itself. The second subject appears not in the conventional relative major but in C minor, articulating a half-cadence at its midpoint and continuing with a varied repetition that concludes with a full cadence. A coda ensues, constructed from material of the first subject and confined harmonically to the tonic and dominant of C minor. The exposition closes with a transitional passage that modulates toward the development section.
