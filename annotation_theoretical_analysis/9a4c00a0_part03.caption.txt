This constitutes the development section of the movement. The development initially treats previously presented material, engaging in extensive motivic elaboration derived from the first subject and its associated counter-subject. At its midpoint, a new thematic subject is introduced in B minor, marking a distinct contrast through its novel melodic and harmonic character. This new subject is subsequently integrated into the ongoing developmental process, as the texture continues to manipulate fragments of the first subject through various contrapuntal and harmonic transformations. The section as a whole functions to destabilize tonal centers established earlier and to explore remote harmonic areas, while maintaining organic continuity through its reliance on previously stated motivic cells.
