This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. It opens with a first subject firmly rooted in the tonic key. This is followed by a transition that begins with an unbroken sequential passage leading to dominant harmony; while some theorists assimilate this material into the first subject, its functional trajectory toward the dominant supports its classification as a distinct transitional section. The second subject then appears in the dominant key (G major), presented as a single thematic section—a structural simplicity deemed appropriate given the movement’s concise design—and includes within it a descending tonal sequence. The exposition concludes with a codetta, though certain analytical interpretations extend the second subject through this material to the double bar. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
