This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, is highly compact, comprising two overlapping three-bar phrases wherein the second phrase constitutes a literal repetition of the first. A bridge-passage or transition follows, remaining predominantly in the tonic key of C major despite fleeting modulatory digressions; it culminates in a half-cadence that establishes harmonic expectation for the secondary theme. The second subject begins unconventionally in A minor—the relative minor—opening with a two-bar phrase that is immediately transposed down a step to G major, the dominant key, in which the remainder of the section unfolds. This first section of the second subject incorporates a descending sequential passage, initially stated and then modified upon its immediate repetition; the entire section is significantly extended through multiple repetitions and concludes with a perfect cadence. The second section of the second subject consists exclusively of cadential repetitions and extensions, reinforcing the dominant key before the exposition’s close.
