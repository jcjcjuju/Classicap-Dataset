This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with thematic material derived from the bass line of the closing bars of the second subject, which is treated as a motivic subject and subjected to sequential repetition at various pitch levels over a pedal point. This contrapuntal treatment persists through an extended passage that ultimately resolves into C major. Within this key, a new episodic passage emerges, characterized by modulatory activity that transitions the tonal center back to E minor. The development concludes with a dominant harmony of B minor, preparing for the subsequent recapitulation.
