This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of F minor, with its initial phrase presented in a newly varied form, while its second phrase reappears without alteration. A connecting episode follows, closely modeled on its counterpart from the exposition and initially remaining in the tonic key; however, its latter portion modulates to D-flat major. The subdominant chord of D-flat major is then repurposed as a Neapolitan sixth chord in F minor, facilitating the return of the second subject in the tonic key rather than the dominant or relative major. The second subject is thus restated entirely in F minor. A coda follows, identical in content to the exposition’s coda and based on the first subject, employing tonic and dominant harmonies of F minor. This coda, however, does not conclude the movement but is succeeded by a transitional passage that leads to an unusual structural repetition of the development and recapitulation. Subsequently, a further transitional passage introduces the final coda, marked “Presto,” which commences with a new thematic subject in two repeated parts—first in the tonic key and then in A-flat major—and culminates in a final section derived from the first subject.
