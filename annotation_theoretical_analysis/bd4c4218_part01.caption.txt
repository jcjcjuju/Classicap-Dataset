This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of F minor and concludes with a half-close; it is structured in a regular two-bar rhythmic pattern. A connecting episode follows, derived primarily from the motivic material of the second and third bars of the first subject. The second subject then appears in A-flat major, the relative major of the tonic minor, establishing a conventional tonal relationship for the secondary theme in a minor-mode sonata exposition. The exposition concludes with a coda that reinforces the structural closure before the double bar, after which the entire exposition is repeated.
