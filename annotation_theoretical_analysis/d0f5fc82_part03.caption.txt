This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key without alteration, preserving its original melodic and rhythmic characteristics as presented in the exposition. The subsequent bridge-passage or transition is expanded through the interpolation of four bars that modulate sequentially through C minor and B flat major; this extension functions as a sequential repetition of the immediately preceding material and is harmonically adjusted to prepare for the return of the second subject in the tonic key rather than the dominant. The second subject then appears entirely in the tonic, maintaining its bipartite structure: the first section presents a sixteen-bar sentence in four-bar phrases with a varied repetition leading to a full cadence, while the second section alternates between major and minor modes of the tonic, featuring bass-register melodies, sequential modulations, reiterated half-cadences in the minor mode, and a final shift to the major mode for its concluding phrase, which is restated an octave higher with cadential extensions. The movement concludes with a codetta that replicates the thematic and structural content of the exposition’s codetta, now transposed into the tonic key, and no independent coda follows.
