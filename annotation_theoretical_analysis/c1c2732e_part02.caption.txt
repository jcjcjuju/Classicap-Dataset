This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. It commences in F major with motivic material derived from the slurred figures of the second subject, accompanied by a varied continuation of the codetta’s accompanimental texture. The second phrase of the first subject is then transposed into F major, followed by sequential treatment of triplet-based figuration that transiently touches upon G minor and C major before effecting a definitive modulation to G minor. Subsequently, the texture incorporates demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) figures originating from the first subject alongside additional fragmented allusions to the second subject. A modulation to E flat major initiates a tonally unstable passage in which the music oscillates between G minor and C minor. The section ultimately returns to F major, whose final chord is reinterpreted enharmonically as the dominant of B flat major, thereby preparing the tonal return of the recapitulation.
