This constitutes the episode of a sonata-form movement. It begins with a transitional connecting passage that initially recalls the earlier transition but subsequently modulates through G minor to E♭ major, where the episode proper commences with a new melody. This melodic material is thematically distinct from the principal and second subjects of the exposition. The transition features chords of the augmented sixth and an inversion of parts, while certain motivic figures bear resemblance to those found in the opening phrase of the principal subject. Following the episode, a passage leads toward the recapitulation: rather than resolving with a full cadence, it presents an interrupted cadence, succeeded by a cadential repetition that modulates to C minor. Here, the opening phrase of the principal subject reappears, transposed to B♭ major, which then shifts to the minor mode. This statement is prolonged through transient modulations via G♭ major and E♭ minor before settling in B♭ minor. A lengthened version of the earlier link passage follows, functioning as a retransition and preparing the return of the principal subject in the tonic. This retransitional section includes prominent augmented sixth chords.
