This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of C minor, preserving its original thematic material derived from the initial six-note motive. This is followed by a connecting episode that remains untransposed relative to its exposition counterpart and exhibits only slight variation in its figuration. The second subject then appears not in the tonic minor but in the parallel major, C major; however, its cadential articulation ultimately resolves into C minor, thereby reaffirming the tonic key. The movement concludes with an extended coda that initially transposes earlier coda material into the tonic key. At a structural juncture, the music modulates enharmonically—via a diminished seventh chord—to D flat major, where a five-bar phrase ends on a dominant seventh chord. This is succeeded by a literal quotation of the opening five bars of the second subject, still in D flat major, which again cadences on the dominant seventh of that key. A subsequent enharmonic modulation, again mediated by a diminished seventh chord, returns the music to the tonic key. The movement closes over a tonic pedal point in C minor, alternating fragments of the first six notes of the second subject with those of the first subject.
