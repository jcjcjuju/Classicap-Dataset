This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of F major, now accompanied by a scale passage. The connecting episode follows, reappearing with a four-bar passage in G minor, which is then repeated in G minor and B-flat major. A brilliant variation of the first subject ensues, beginning in B-flat minor and modulating to conclude on the dominant chord, thereby preparing the return of the second subject in the tonic key. The second subject reappears in F major, extended in length and functioning as a short coda. The entire development and recapitulation are subject to an unusual repeat.
