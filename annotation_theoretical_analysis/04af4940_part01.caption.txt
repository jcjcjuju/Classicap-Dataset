This constitutes the enunciation section of a fugue in G major, functioning as the exposition and its immediate extensions through invertible counterpoint and episodic material. The section opens with the subject presented in the treble voice in the tonic key of G major. This is followed by a real answer in the alto voice in the dominant key of D major, accompanied by a codetta in the treble and the first appearance of the counter-subject in the treble voice during bars 6–8. A brief codetta recurs before the subject reappears in the bass, now restated in the tonic G major, with the counter-subject provided in the alto. Episode I ensues, modulating from G major to C major and returning to G major, constructed from the codetta figure introduced earlier. The exposition is then extended through a counter-exposition beginning at bar 20, wherein the subject and counter-subject are presented in free inversion: first with the inverted subject in the alto and an incomplete inverted counter-subject in the bass (G major), followed by an inverted answer in the treble with an inverted counter-subject in the alto (D major), and concluding with the inverted subject in the bass and an incomplete inverted counter-subject in the treble (G major). Throughout, the counter-subject appears consistently in invertible counterpoint with the subject or its inversion, and all episodes derive motivically from the codetta figure introduced in bars 5–6.
