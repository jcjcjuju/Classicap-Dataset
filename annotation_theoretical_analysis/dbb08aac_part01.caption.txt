This constitutes the exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in F major. The exposition begins with the subject stated in the treble in the tonic key of F major, followed by a tonal answer in the alto in the dominant key of C major, presented without a counter-subject. A codetta ensues, modulating through a sequence of keys—C major, G minor, B-flat major, D minor—and ultimately returning to F major. The subject then reappears in the bass in F major, succeeded by a second codetta that modulates from F major to C major, leading to a tonal answer in the bass in C major. The modulatory section commences with Episode I, which departs from C major and traverses various transient keys before reestablishing F major; this is followed by a statement of the subject in the alto in F major. Episode II then modulates from F major to B-flat major, utilizing motivic material derived from the first codetta, including its inversion, and features a pedal point in its latter portion. A subject entry follows in the bass in B-flat major, succeeded by Episode III, which modulates back to F major and incorporates brief canonical imitation between treble and alto before dissolving into freer treatment, also employing a pedal point. The recapitulatory section presents the subject in the treble in F major, immediately followed by another statement of the subject in the bass in F major, the latter featuring a sequential repetition of the subject’s first phrase, transposed successively one note higher on each iteration. The movement concludes with a coda firmly in F major.
