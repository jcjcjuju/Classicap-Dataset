This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of C major and is rhythmically unified by the motive introduced in its opening bar; it concludes with a cadential closure, followed by a varied and prolonged repetition of its latter portion. A connecting episode ensues, constructed from new thematic material and culminating on a dominant harmony—an unusual tonal goal for such a transitional passage. The second subject follows, articulated in two distinct tonal and modal areas: it begins in G minor (the dominant minor) with a two-bar phrase succeeded by a four-bar phrase, then shifts to G major (the dominant major) for its continuation. This section is derived from an earlier Pianoforte Quartet. The exposition concludes with a coda that introduces a short thematic idea, which later reappears at the outset of the development section.
