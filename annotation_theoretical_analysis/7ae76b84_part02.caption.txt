This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section commences with a sentence in the dominant key, constructed from the opening motive of the first subject in combination with a three-note figure derived from the second section of the second subject. This sentence remains predominantly in F major, aside from a brief modulation to G minor, and concludes with a striking shift to F minor on its final chord, effecting a modulation into that key; the cadence itself replicates the harmonic and rhythmic configuration found in the third section of the second subject. Following this cadence, the texture engages in motivic development drawing upon the semiquaver (sixteenth-note) passagework from the second subject’s first section as well as the primary thematic figure of the movement. The harmonic trajectory proceeds through a sequence of modulations—C minor, B-flat major, and G minor—culminating in a repeated half-cadence in G minor. The development then transitions via a passage centered on the dominant of B-flat major, which alternates between major and minor modes of the key, functioning as a retransitional link that prepares the return of the first subject in the tonic.
