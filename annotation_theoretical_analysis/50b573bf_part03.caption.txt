This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata-form movement. It begins with the second subject, now slightly lengthened and transposed to unfold in the keys of D major (subdominant) and A major (tonic), ultimately closing on a half cadence in A minor. This is followed by the third entry of the principal subject, which is both considerably varied and expanded through cadential repetitions. The original final cadence of the principal subject is evaded by an inverted cadence in F♯ minor—the relative minor of the tonic key—and is subsequently restated at the conclusion of the extended cadential passage.
