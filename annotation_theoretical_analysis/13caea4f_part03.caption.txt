This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form, presenting the principal thematic material transposed to the tonic key area. The first subject theme returns in D major, characterized by imitative counterpoint in the bass, and modulates to the tonic minor (D minor) in its closing phrase. The second subject theme follows, initially stated in D major before shifting to D minor from its latter portion onward, ultimately concluding with a perfect cadence. A coda ensues, affirming D major through a sustained tonic pedal in the bass.
