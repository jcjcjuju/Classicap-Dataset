This constitutes the Trio section in Simple Binary form. The first subject is presented in A minor (tonic) and spans two phrases, concluding not in the tonic but in E minor, the dominant minor. This material is then repeated in its entirety. Following the repeat, a developmental section commences in C major, subsequently modulating to D minor before returning to A minor; this passage employs a rhythmic structure identical to that of the Scherzo’s developmental section. The first subject then reappears in its original key of A minor, now varied and altered so as to cadence firmly in the tonic A minor rather than in E minor as in its initial statement. This restatement is also repeated in full.
