This constitutes the first half of a binary-form prelude, comprising two thematic periods followed by a double bar. The opening period begins with a tonic pedal in E major, establishing the home key through sustained harmonic support. This is succeeded by a dominant pedal that leads to a perfect cadence in the dominant key, B major. The second period commences directly in B major and modulates through F♯ minor and C♯ minor before reaffirming the dominant key. A dominant pedal underpins a descending imitative sequence in the upper voices, forming a coda that solidifies B major through harmonic repetition and culminates in a perfect cadence in the dominant, marked by a double bar.
