This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key and structured as a sixteen-bar sentence, concluding with a full close; it is subsequently extended to twenty bars through cadential repetitions. The second half of this sentence (bars 9–16) constitutes a varied repetition of the initial eight-bar phrase, with the half-close originally occurring in bars 7–8 replaced by a full close in bars 15–16. A bridge-passage follows, characterized by a melodious quality; its second phrase begins a diatonic step higher than the first and opens with an imitation of the initial melodic figure. This transition modulates to G major—the dominant key—by bar 31 and concludes with a half-cadence in that key. The second subject unfolds in G major and is divided into two distinct sections. The first section (bars 33–47) exhibits an unconventional phrase structure: its opening spans two and a half bars, though the bass continues independently to complete a four-bar span; this phrase is then repeated in bars 37–39, immediately followed by a responsive four-bar phrase (bars 39–43) that enters without reiteration of the preceding unaccompanied bass material. In the repetition of this responsive phrase, the anticipated full cadence is disrupted by the isolated sounding of the fifth of the tonic chord on the strong beat of bar 47, thereby arresting harmonic closure. The second section (bars 47–61) contrasts sharply with the first through its reliance on broken chord figuration, as opposed to the earlier stepwise motion. It begins with a two-bar phrase that is repeated, followed by a responsive phrase commencing on the second sixteenth note of bar 51 and extending to bar 55; this phrase incorporates a brief modulation to C major in bars 52–53 before resolving with a perfect cadence in G major. This responsive phrase is then repeated, with its repetition expanded to six bars. The exposition concludes with a codetta sustained over a tonic pedal point, interrupted only at the final cadence.
