This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of C minor, preserving its original thematic identity. The subsequent connecting episode initiates with a restatement of the opening four bars of the first subject and is predominantly developed from material originally found in bars 5–6 of that subject; this transitional passage diverges significantly in content from its exposition counterpart, both at its outset and conclusion. The second subject follows, initially presented not in the tonic but in F minor, before modulating to C minor at its midpoint, such that the remainder of the second subject—including its subsequent thematic portions—appears firmly within the tonic key. The movement concludes with a coda that opens with a fragment of the first subject, proceeds through a four-bar “Grave” passage derived from the introductory material, and terminates with a final allusion to the first subject.
