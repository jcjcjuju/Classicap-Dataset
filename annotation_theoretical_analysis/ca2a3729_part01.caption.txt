This constitutes the exposition of a binary form. The first period establishes the tonic minor key through a tonic pedal and presents a thematic figure that is subsequently transposed to the subdominant minor, C, where it concludes with a perfect cadence in that key; this phrase is then followed by a continuation that modulates to the dominant minor, D, culminating in a perfect cadence in D minor. The second period begins in D minor with an exact transposition of the opening thematic figure and initiates a sequential harmonic descent through C minor, G minor, and F minor before returning to the tonic minor, G, where a tonic pedal reaffirms the home key. The section concludes with a coda over a sustained tonic pedal, ending with a perfect cadence in G minor.
