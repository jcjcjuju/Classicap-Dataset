This constitutes the thematic foundation of the movement, presented as a binary-form Air. The structure is divided into two balanced sections, each subjected to literal repetition in performance practice. The first section establishes the tonic key and culminates in a half cadence on the dominant, creating harmonic openness. The second section modulates through related harmonic areas before achieving a conclusive authentic cadence in the tonic, thereby providing structural closure. The melodic and harmonic content of both sections serves as the basis for all subsequent variations.
