This constitutes a variation within a theme-and-variations form. The fourth variation is characterized by a metrical shift to 9/8 time, establishing a marked contrast with the preceding variation. Its construction is based predominantly on the motivic figure introduced in its opening bar, which serves as the primary material for development throughout most of the section. An exception occurs in a brief passage of contrasting character, which departs from the established figuration and introduces new thematic content.
