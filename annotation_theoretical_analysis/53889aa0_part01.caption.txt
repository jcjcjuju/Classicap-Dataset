This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, unfolds as a ten-bar sentence in which the second phrase is expanded from four to six bars through free sequential imitation; this sentence concludes with a cadence in the dominant. A subsequent sentence continues without pause into the transition, which is brief and sequential in character, modulating through G minor and culminating in a half-cadence in F major—the dominant key. The second subject then ensues in F major, divided into two sections. The first section (Bars 23–33) is derived from the opening motive of the first subject, now placed in the bass and paired with a new counter-subject in the treble; it resolves onto a first-inversion tonic chord of F major. The second section (Bars 33–46) introduces a new thematic idea over a tonic pedal, with both phrases extended through cadential repetitions and brief excursions into F minor and A-flat major; of particular note is the appearance of a Neapolitan sixth chord. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
