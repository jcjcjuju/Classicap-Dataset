This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, spans a sixteen-bar structure organized in four-bar periodic phrasing. Its second phrase concludes with an implied passing modulation to the dominant key, suggesting a perfect cadence through an incomplete dominant seventh chord that omits the raised third—the characteristic note of the dominant key. The third phrase (corresponding to bars 9–12) restates the opening melodic material with an added semiquaver counter-subject in the bass, while the final phrase transfers these semiquaver figures to the treble. Melodic sequencing is evident in the initial four-bar phrase and again between the fifth and sixth bars. A transition follows, beginning with a brief tonic pedal and remaining entirely within the tonic key before concluding on a half-cadence. The second subject then appears in the dominant key (A major), structured in three distinct sections. The first section derives its thematic material from the opening motive of the first subject, now presented in the bass and accompanied by a new treble counter-subject; a sequential repetition modulates to B minor, leading to a half-cadence in A major via an augmented sixth chord resolving to the dominant. An overlapping passage ensues over a pedal point, featuring the motive in the treble imitated in inverse motion by the tenor, producing contrary motion throughout a sequential progression. After the pedal ceases, the section continues with arpeggiated and broken-chord textures culminating in an inverted cadence. The second section develops material from the latter part of the preceding section, distinguished by a syncopated melody combined with a modulating sequence based on a descending passage. The third section is founded on a descending scale passage, with its second phrase varying the first and concluding with a full cadence rather than a half-cadence. A codetta follows, built over a pedal point, which modulates back to the tonic key and prepares for the subsequent return of the first subject.
