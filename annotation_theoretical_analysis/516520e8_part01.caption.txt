This constitutes the exposition of a binary-form prelude. The first period establishes the tonic key through a tonic pedal in its opening and closing gestures, framing a harmonic digression that touches upon F major and B♭ major before reasserting the tonic region. This period concludes with a perfect cadence in the dominant minor, A minor. The second period begins with a transposition of the opening material into A minor, maintaining the inversion of the two voices as in the initial statement, and is underpinned by a dominant pedal that reinforces the new tonal center. A descending scale in A minor initiates further harmonic motion, leading to brief tonicizations of G minor and D minor before culminating in a perfect cadence in the tonic key, D major. The movement closes with a coda featuring a tonic pedal that solidifies the home key.
