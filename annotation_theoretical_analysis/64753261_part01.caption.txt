This constitutes the exposition and subsequent digression of a sonata form. The principal subject is presented in the tonic key, followed by accessory bars that extend its thematic material. A transition section then modulates to the dominant, preparing the arrival of the second subject in A major. The second subject comprises two distinct sections: the first is a sixteen-bar sentence organized in four-bar phrases, featuring a half cadence at its midpoint and a varied repetition of its initial half that concludes with a full cadence; within this section, the opening motive is imitated in the bass. The second section of the second subject presents an eight-bar sentence that is repeated, with the repetition extended through cadential elaborations both internal to and beyond the cadence. A brief link follows, leading to a complete restatement of the principal subject in the tonic. This re-entry is succeeded by a transition derived from the initial transitional material, which modulates through a series of keys—E minor, D major, and finally B minor—by transposing a cadential formula and converting it into a half cadence to prepare the ensuing episodes.
