This constitutes the first variation of a theme-and-variations form. The variation is characterized by pervasive syncopation, occurring in nearly every bar, which displaces rhythmic accents and creates a sense of metric tension against the underlying pulse. The harmonic and melodic framework remains rooted in the structure of the original theme, though the rhythmic treatment significantly alters its surface articulation. No modulation or harmonic divergence is indicated; the variation operates within the tonal and formal boundaries established by the initial statement of the theme.
