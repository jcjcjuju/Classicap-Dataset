This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of E major and is structured in three distinct segments: an initial four-bar thematic statement followed by an immediate literal repetition in octaves; an eight-bar continuation that begins in the dominant key, modulates to A major, and ultimately resolves back to the tonic, also repeated in octaves; and a final varied restatement of the opening four-bar idea along with its repetition. An episode follows, derived motivically from the second segment of the first subject, functioning as a transition that modulates to the dominant key. The second subject then appears in B major and is divided into two parts: the first part unfolds over an inverted dominant pedal point of B major, featuring a varied repetition of its initial six-bar phrase; the second part presents a four-bar phrase in B major, immediately repeated but transposed to the tonic key of E major, and extended by two bars to prepare for the return of the first subject. This return constitutes a literal recapitulation of the entire first subject in its original tonic key.
