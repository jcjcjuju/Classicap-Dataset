This constitutes the exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory section of a fugue in E minor. The exposition begins with the subject stated in the treble in the tonic key of E minor, followed by a six-quaver codetta that modulates to B minor. A real answer then appears in the alto in B minor, accompanied by the counter-subject in the treble; this is succeeded by a restatement of the subject in the bass in E minor, now paired with the counter-subject in the alto. The modulatory section comprises five episodes interspersed with further entries of the subject or answer. Episode I modulates from E minor to G major and introduces new motivic material derived from the final portion of the subject. This is followed by a statement of the subject in the treble in G major, with the counter-subject in the alto, slightly altered in its course. An answer then appears in the alto in D major, accompanied by the counter-subject in the treble. Episode II modulates from D major to B minor and is constructed primarily from the second half of the fifth bar of the subject. A subject entry follows in the bass in B minor with the counter-subject in the alto, leading into Episode III, which modulates back to E minor and mirrors the construction of Episode I. Another subject statement ensues in the alto in E minor, accompanied by the counter-subject in the bass. Episode IV then modulates sequentially through A minor, D minor, G major, and C major, employing a new figure in the alto, thematic material from bars 5–6 of the subject in the treble, and a steady quarter-note bass line. This leads to a subject entry in the treble in A minor, again with the counter-subject in the alto, slightly altered near its conclusion. Episode V modulates back to E minor, culminating in a half-close and pause. The recapitulatory section commences with a fragment of the subject in the bass in E minor, immediately followed by an inverted statement of the same fragment in the treble. This is succeeded by a full statement of the subject in the bass in E minor, accompanied by the counter-subject in the alto. The movement concludes with a coda firmly grounded in E minor.
