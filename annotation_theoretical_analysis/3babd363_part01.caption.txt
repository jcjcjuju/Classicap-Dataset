This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key, structured initially in a clear four-bar periodic phrase rhythm for sixteen bars, culminating in an inverted cadence; the subsequent eight-bar passage resists similar subdivision. A tonic pedal underpins the opening material, while textural inversion occurs as semiquaver (sixteenth note) figures originally in the treble are transferred to the bass, followed by slurred quaver (eighth note) figures similarly migrating from treble to bass. The bridge-passage or transition derives its thematic content from the first subject and begins over a pedal, during which semiquaver figures in the bass are consistently answered by corresponding figures in the treble in the following bar. Harmonically, this section alternates between C major and G major before modulating to D major—the dominant—where it concludes with an inverted cadence. The second subject unfolds in D major and is partitioned into three distinct sections, each terminating with a perfect cadence in the dominant key. The first section introduces two primary motives: a repeated triplet figure and a smaller rhythmic figure, with its second half expanded by a newly introduced two-beat prefix to the original opening motive. The second section commences with motivic material developed from the latter portion of the first section, now distributed contrapuntally between voices; it initiates a real sequence through successive transpositions into B minor, G major, and E minor, and includes the first inversion of the chromatic dominant minor ninth chord in D major. The third section opens with a new thematic idea that briefly modulates to B minor and features a chromatic harmonic progression comprising successive appearances of the second inversion of a diminished triad, the diminished triad itself, and a repeated second inversion—a rare harmonic configuration. Following a perfect cadence in D major, this phrase is restated in inversion and significantly extended through interpolated material and cadential prolongation, incorporating earlier thematic content with inverted voice leading. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
