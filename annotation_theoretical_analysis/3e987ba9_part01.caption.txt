This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, is structured as a six-bar sentence comprising three two-bar phrases; while the melodic line in the treble concludes on the first beat of the final bar, the harmonic motion prolongs the phrase until the second beat in the bass. A bridge passage follows, functioning as a transition that modulates through B♭ major before arriving in C major—the dominant key—where it concludes with an inverted cadence. The second subject then unfolds in C major, initiated by a motive repeated three times, each iteration accompanied by a slightly varied upper-voice sequence. Through elision, the responsive phrase is initially contracted to seven bars, after which a lengthened and varied repetition extends the entire second subject to sixteen bars; notably, between the fourteenth and seventeenth bars, the musical texture undergoes an inversion of parts. A three-bar codetta ensues, which, though closely linked to the second subject, is distinguished by its later separation in the movement’s coda. The exposition concludes with both a double bar and repeat marks—a formal feature of particular interest given its rarity in slow movements cast in unabridged sonata form, yet consistent with Mozart’s practice in comparable piano sonata slow movements.
