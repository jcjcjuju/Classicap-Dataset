This constitutes the second subject group of a sonata-form exposition. The section begins with a thematic idea presented in E♭ major, which remains diatonically stable throughout its presentation, as the second subject neither modulates nor departs from this key. Following this self-contained thematic statement, a transitional passage ensues that functions as a retransition, systematically preparing the return to the tonic key of G minor through harmonic and motivic means.
