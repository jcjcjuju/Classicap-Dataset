This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage is of limited scope and exclusively engages with material derived from the first subject. No new thematic content is introduced; rather, the motivic essence of the opening theme—specifically its initial six-note figure—is subjected to developmental treatment. The harmonic language remains fluid, avoiding stable tonal centers, consistent with the function of a development to destabilize and rework expositional material.
