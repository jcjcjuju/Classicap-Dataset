This constitutes the final variation and subsequent restatement of the theme in a variation movement. The sixth variation commences in the original 3/4 meter and functions as an elaborate recomposition of the opening two bars of the Air, initially presented with near-original simplicity. The variation technique becomes evident immediately thereafter, as two contrapuntal lines originally notated in quarter notes are transformed into eighth-note motion. A metrical shift to 9/8 occurs at the fifth bar, accompanied by triplet eighth-note figuration in the accompaniment, which intensifies rhythmically: sixteenth notes appear in the following bar, succeeded by thirty-second notes upon the return to 3/4 meter. At the twelfth bar, a new variation texture emerges, sustained for four bars, after which a virtuosic episode unfolds over a dominant pedal point. This episode undergoes inversion, coinciding with the entrance of the second half of the Air—now varied—in the treble register. The variation section concludes at the thirty-sixth bar, giving way to an unadorned restatement of the complete Air in its original form, presented without internal repeats.
