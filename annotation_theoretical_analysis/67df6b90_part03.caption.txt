This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in its original state in the tonic key of E minor, reproducing the thematic and harmonic content of its initial presentation without modification. This is followed by a connecting episode that employs the same motivic material as in the exposition, now transposed to ensure its conclusion in the tonic key rather than modulating to a secondary key area. The second subject then appears transposed into the tonic key of E minor, maintaining its original structure and character without alterations. The movement concludes with an elongated coda, which extends the final cadential affirmation of the tonic beyond the scope of the exposition’s closing section.
