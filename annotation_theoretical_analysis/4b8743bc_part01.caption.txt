This constitutes the first part of a binary-form prelude, functioning as the initial period that establishes the tonic key and modulates to the dominant. It opens with a tonic pedal in the bass, over which a dominant pedal is reiterated in semiquavers in the treble. This texture gives way to a dominant pedal in the treble accompanied by a supertonic pedal in the tenor. The period concludes with a perfect cadence in the dominant key, D major, marked by a double bar, thereby fulfilling the tonal and structural conventions of the first section in early binary form.
