This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of E flat major, presented without alteration from its initial appearance in the exposition. It is followed by a connecting episode that closely mirrors the length and character of its earlier counterpart, though with a minor omission and crucial harmonic adjustment: it is modified to conclude in the tonic key rather than modulating to the dominant. The second subject then appears, now transposed to the tonic key of E flat major, fulfilling the tonal resolution typical of sonata-form recapitulations. The movement concludes with an extensive coda, which predominantly develops the “Le-be-wohl” phrase through a series of varied textures and contrapuntal treatments. These include monophonic statements, parallel thirds, accompanimental semiquaver (sixteenth-note) figuration both below and above the thematic line, canonic imitation at the octave below—including a diminution of the phrase—and a final presentation over an inverted pedal point. A brief reference to the first subject interrupts this otherwise continuous elaboration of the “Le-be-wohl” motive.
