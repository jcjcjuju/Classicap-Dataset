This constitutes the exposition of a sonata-rondo form. The principal subject, presented in the tonic key, is unusually extended and internally varied, comprising two large sections, each concluding with a perfect cadence in the tonic. The second of these sections further subdivides into two distinct thematic ideas, thereby rendering the principal subject threefold in design. A minimal link follows, consisting of a single dominant seventh chord in E-flat major, which functions as a harmonic pivot to the relative major without a conventional transition passage. The second subject then unfolds in E-flat major; its two sections are both prolonged through cadential repetitions, and its latter portion is thematically linked to the second subject of the first movement of the same sonata. A brief modulatory link ensues, effecting a return from E-flat major to the tonic minor (C minor) through a short passage that prepares the subsequent return of the principal subject. This second entry of the principal subject is incomplete: while the first section is fully restated, the second section omits its final phrase and instead reiterates the preceding material over a diminished seventh chord rooted in F minor, thereby initiating a modulation that establishes F minor as the key for the ensuing episode.
