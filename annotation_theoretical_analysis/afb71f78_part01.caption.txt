This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject unfolds in the tonic key and is structured in three distinct sections. The initial section presents a sentence comprising two unequal phrases: the first phrase spans six bars and concludes with a half-cadence, while the second phrase, a varied repetition of the first, is extended to eight bars and culminates in a full cadence. The second section offers a marked stylistic contrast, characterized by a quiet, song-like quality within its compact eight-bar span, during which the opening motivic figure recurs three times. The third section begins with a four-bar phrase that effects a transient modulation to D minor; this phrase is subsequently repeated, now expanded to five bars and altered to achieve a perfect cadence in the tonic, followed by a four-bar tonic pedal point.  

The bridge passage initiates in the relative minor and features extensive imitative counterpoint, with the bass echoing the treble at a one-bar delay and an octave lower. Its second phrase constitutes a sequential variation of the first, transposed into C major, and is succeeded by a brief sequence that leads to a half-cadence.  

The second subject appears in the dual keys of the dominant minor and major. Its first section remains entirely in the dominant minor—a relatively uncommon practice among earlier classical composers—yet concludes with a Tierce de Picardie, thereby preparing the shift to the dominant major for the ensuing section. Within this first section, the minor seventh scale degree functions harmonically under restricted conditions, and augmented sixth chords occur at two structural points. The second section comprises a single sentence that is immediately repeated, with the repetition significantly extended through cadential elaboration; its semiquaver figuration occasionally alludes motivically to the opening material of the first subject.
