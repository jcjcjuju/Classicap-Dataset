This constitutes the episode of a sonata-rondo form. The episode is unusually brief, diverging from the typical extended "long episode" expected at this formal juncture. It comprises a concise thematic passage presented initially in F minor, which modulates to G minor; this passage is then immediately restated in G minor and subsequently modulates to C minor, the tonic key, thereby functioning as a retransitional passage that prepares the return of the main thematic material in the recapitulation.
