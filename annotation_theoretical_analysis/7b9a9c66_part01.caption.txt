This constitutes the exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in G minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the alto in G minor, followed by a tonal answer in the treble in D minor, accompanied by a countersubject in the alto. A brief codetta leads to a restatement of the subject in the bass in G minor, with the countersubject now in the treble; this is succeeded by an answer in the tenor in D major, paired with a countersubject in the bass. The modulatory section commences with Episode I, which modulates from D minor through a cadence in G minor to B♭ major, where the subject reappears in the alto with a countersubject in the tenor. This is followed by an answer in the bass in F major, with the countersubject retained in the tenor, and another answer in the treble in F major with the countersubject in the bass. The subject then returns in the bass in B♭ major, countered by the treble, leading into an incomplete stretto: an answer enters in the alto in E♭ major before the prior statement has concluded. Subsequently, the subject appears in the bass in C minor with a countersubject in the alto, followed by the subject in the treble in C minor with a slightly altered countersubject in the bass. An answer in the alto in G minor, accompanied by a countersubject in the treble, concludes with a cadence in G minor, preceding Episode II, which modulates from G minor through E♭ major and returns to G minor. The recapitulatory section features a complete stretto: the subject is presented in the treble in G minor with a countersubject in the alto, immediately imitated by the subject in the tenor; the bass then enters with the subject, completing the four-voice stretto. A final statement of the subject occurs in the alto in G minor, with the countersubject in the bass, and the fugue concludes with the subject in the tenor, ending on a Tierce de Picardie in G major, without a coda.
