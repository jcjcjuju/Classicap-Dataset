This constitutes an episode functioning as a developmental interlude. The section introduces no new thematic material, instead deriving its content entirely from motives presented in the preceding tonic-area sentences, now recast with expressive pathos through a shift from the major mode to the minor. The episode begins in the tonic minor (G minor) and unfolds as an eight-bar sentence that modulates to B♭ major. A subsequent eight-bar sentence commences in C minor and ultimately returns to G minor, thereby framing the entire episode within the tonic minor despite its transient harmonic excursions. The expressive character is heightened by these modal and tonal shifts, which imbue the familiar thematic material with a heightened sense of lyrical melancholy.
