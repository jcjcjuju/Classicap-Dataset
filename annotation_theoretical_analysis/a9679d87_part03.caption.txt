This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key without alteration, preserving its original thematic and harmonic content. The bridge-passage or transition follows, reproducing the original transition almost exactly, with the sole exception of a four-bar segment that diverges from the initial statement. The second subject is then presented in the tonic key, transposed nearly literally from its original dominant-key statement in the exposition. Its first section is extended through the interpolation of six bars, within which the opening figure of the subject alternates between exact and modified statements—appearing in the bass in its original form and in the treble in altered guise—each accompanied by a variation of the semiquaver figure derived from the second bar of the subject; this interpolated passage functions as a descending sequence, though it deviates from sequential procedure in its final two bars. The second section of the second subject proceeds without further extension and concludes with a perfect cadence in the tonic. The movement closes with a codetta that restates the codetta from the exposition, now transposed into the tonic key, and no independent coda is present. The entire recapitulation is marked for repetition, in accordance with historical performance practice in Mozart’s keyboard sonatas.
