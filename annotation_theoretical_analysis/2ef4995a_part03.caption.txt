This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The principal subject returns in the tonic key, reaffirming the home tonality with its original thematic material. This is followed by the second subject, now transposed to the tonic key rather than the dominant, thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of the recapitulatory section. The movement concludes with an extended coda, which is predominantly derived from motives of the first subject. Within this coda, imitative counterpoint emerges, specifically referencing the melodic figure first presented in the second bar of the principal subject, and this imitation becomes a salient developmental feature of the closing passage.
