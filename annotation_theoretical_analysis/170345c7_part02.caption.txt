This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. It opens with the thematic subject first introduced in the exposition’s coda, which is then followed by a virtuosic passage characterized by rapid arpeggiated figuration. At a pivotal moment, an enharmonic modulation occurs, facilitating a shift to the remote key of D major, in which the first subject—originally presented in the tonic C major—is restated. The section concludes with a sustained dominant pedal point, creating harmonic tension and preparing for the eventual return of the tonic in the recapitulation.
