This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. It begins with a sixteen-bar episode in C major, which functions as an introductory passage before the core developmental activity commences. The principal developmental material is derived exclusively from the first four bars of the second section of the second subject, which serves as the basis for the entire subsequent working-out. The harmonic trajectory of this section traverses a series of closely related keys: it reiterates C major briefly before modulating to C minor, then proceeds through G minor, D minor, A minor, and ultimately arrives at F major. The transition into F major occurs via a dominant seventh chord, and the section concludes in that key. Within this sequential harmonic framework, a real sequence is articulated between two four-bar spans, reinforcing the motivic unity of the passage. Additionally, the progression through D minor features a striking chromatic inflection in the form of an Italian sixth chord, which contributes to the tonal instability characteristic of the development.
