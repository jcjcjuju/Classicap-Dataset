This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of D minor and is thematically derived from an initial four-note figure, which serves as a foundational motive for the entire movement. A connecting episode follows, beginning in D minor with the initial four-note figure transposed to the bass; this episode modulates to C major at its midpoint and, through the use of an augmented sixth chord on F, effects a modulation to E major—the dominant of A minor—thereby preparing the secondary key area. The second subject appears not in the relative major (F major) but in A minor, the minor dominant, and commences with a two-note figure that complements the four-note motive of the first subject. This thematic duality underpins the movement’s motivic coherence. A coda ensues, developing material from the latter portion of the second subject. The exposition concludes with a transitional passage that leads either to the repeat of the exposition or, upon reiteration, into the development section.
