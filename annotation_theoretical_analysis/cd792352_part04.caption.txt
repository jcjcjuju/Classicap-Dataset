This constitutes the third variation within a theme-and-variations structure. The variation synthesizes the principal textural and rhythmic elements of its predecessors: it integrates the syncopation characteristic of the first variation with the arpeggiated harmonic texture of the second variation, the latter now rendered in demisemiquavers (thirty-second notes). Rather than employing literal repetition of its constituent phrases, the variation unfolds continuously through a process of inversion. Specifically, the material initially presented is subjected to sequential inversion, such that the opening idea is inverted in the subsequent phrase, and this inverted form is itself inverted again in the following phrase, thereby restoring the original contour in the final phrase. This systematic inversion across successive eight-bar spans creates a coherent, through-composed design that maintains motivic unity while elaborating the harmonic and rhythmic vocabulary established earlier in the movement.
