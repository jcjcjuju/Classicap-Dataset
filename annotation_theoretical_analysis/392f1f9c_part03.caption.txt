This constitutes the second theme of the movement, presented in two parts within the key of E♭ major. The first part opens with a V⁹–I progression that integrates the F and C from the preceding passage, followed immediately by a similar progression transposed up a fifth, initially creating tonal ambiguity between B♭ and E♭ major. This ambiguity is resolved as the harmony embarks on a circle-of-fifths sequence spanning four bars, articulated through descending root motion in the bass (F–B♭–E♭–A♭–D–G–C–F), while the melody employs suspensions and appoggiaturas to generate expressive dissonance. A restatement of the theme commences thereafter, culminating in a conclusive VI⁷–II⁷–V⁷–I cadential progression that firmly establishes E♭ major. Throughout this section, the accompaniment maintains a continuous quarter-note broken-chord texture, and the melodic line features syncopation, including an implied hemiola in two consecutive bars where the right-hand rhythm suggests a 3/2 grouping within the prevailing meter. The second part continues in E♭ major, underpinned by a tonic pedal in the bass for an extended duration. Its melodic material occasionally echoes the contour of the first theme, particularly in its use of stepwise motion and neighbor-note decoration. In the final phrase of this part, the harmonic bass line ascends by thirds (E♭–G–B♭–D), effecting a modulation toward A minor and arriving on the dominant of that key.
