This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key and concludes with a perfect cadence; although notated in 4/4 time, the underlying meter is functionally 2/4, rendering the four notated bars as a single eight-bar sentence composed of two four-bar phrases organized in two-bar rhythmic units. A bridge passage follows, modulating to G major—the dominant key—by its second bar and concluding with a half-cadence in that key. The second subject then unfolds in G major, featuring a responsive phrase that exhibits an apparent accentual inversion due to the mismatch between notated meter (4/4) and true metrical organization (2/4). This effect arises from an immediate overlapping repetition of the phrase, wherein the latter half of the cadential bar serves dually as the final bar of the initial phrase and the opening bar of the repetition—an elision that becomes transparent when the passage is reconceived in 2/4 time, aligning all phrase beginnings with strong metric accents. The exposition closes with a link on dominant harmony, which facilitates the repeat of the entire exposition.
