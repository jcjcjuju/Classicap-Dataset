This constitutes the exposition of a fugal movement. It opens with the subject presented in the treble voice in C♯ major. This is followed by a tonal answer in the alto, transposed to the dominant key of G♯ major, accompanied by Counter-subject 1 in the treble. The exposition continues with a third entry of the subject in the bass, again in the tonic key of C♯ major, now accompanied simultaneously by Counter-subject 2 in the treble and Counter-subject 1 in the alto. An episode ensues, modulating from C♯ major to G♯ major through a descending sequential process; this episode begins with an overlap of the concluding material of Counter-subject 2. The exposition concludes with a further statement of the answer in the treble in G♯ major, accompanied by Counter-subject 1 in the alto and a newly introduced Counter-subject 3 in the bass, the latter of which remains absent from the texture until its later reappearance in the recapitulatory section.
