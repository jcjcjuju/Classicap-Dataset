This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of D minor; it spans nine bars, with its initial four-bar section expanded to five bars, and both begins and concludes firmly in the tonic. A connecting episode follows, originating in D minor and modulating to C major, structured as two distinct four-bar sections. The second subject then appears not in the expected relative major (F major) but in A minor—the dominant minor—commencing with a four-bar sentence that is subsequently repeated, varied, and elongated. The exposition closes with a coda derived motivically from material previously heard in the latter portion of the connecting episode, thereby providing a cohesive yet tonally distinct conclusion to the section.
