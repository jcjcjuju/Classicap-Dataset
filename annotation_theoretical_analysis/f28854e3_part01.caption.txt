This constitutes the exposition of a binary or rounded binary form, articulated in three distinct periods. The first period establishes the tonic key of C major and subsequently modulates away from the dominant, culminating in a perfect cadence in the dominant key. The second period begins in the dominant key and initiates a gradual harmonic return to the tonic, achieving closure with a cadence in C major. The third period functions as an extended coda, featuring a dominant pedal point that sustains harmonic tension before resolving into a tonic pedal point, thereby reinforcing the tonal stability of the home key through prolonged pedal tones. Throughout, harmonic change occurs nearly every bar, and the texture remains homogeneous, underpinned by a sostenuto bass figure that contributes to the passage’s structural solidity.
