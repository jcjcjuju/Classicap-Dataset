This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of G major and is structured in two sections, the first concluding with a cadence that leads into a second section, together forming a complete thematic statement. This entire first subject is then followed by a varied repetition of itself, preserving its essential melodic and harmonic character while introducing ornamental or textural alterations. An episode ensues, constructed entirely from the initial motivic figure of the first subject; it commences in E minor and proceeds through modulations to D major and subsequently to A major, arriving at a cadence in the latter. The second subject follows in D major—the dominant key—and is harmonically restricted to alternating tonic and dominant sonorities, with the dominant consistently voiced in an inner part. A transitional episode then unfolds, functioning as a retransition by modulating back to the tonic key of G major. The exposition concludes with a restatement of the first subject in its original key, now presented without the internal repetition found in its initial appearance.
