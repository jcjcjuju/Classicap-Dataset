This constitutes the episode section of a sonata-rondo form, comprising two distinct episodes separated by a partial return of the principal subject. Episode I begins with a melody in D minor, whose initial two-bar idea is sequentially repeated. The responsive phrase reverts to subdued figuration derived from the principal subject. A brief link follows, leading to a second section in B-flat major that modulates through G minor and concludes with a half-cadence in F minor, followed by another linking passage. The principal subject then reappears in its original tonic key, though only its initial twelve-bar structure is presented. Episode II ensues, structured in three parts: Part i unfolds in F minor and A-flat major, featuring a descending sequence in which the upper voices employ double counterpoint, with the alto imitating the treble at the fifth below; its responsive phrase modulates to the relative major and closes with a perfect cadence, after which the part is repeated. Part ii develops the opening motive through sequential treatment in B-flat minor and A-flat major, ultimately arriving at a half-cadence in F minor. Part iii presents a literal repetition of Part i, now transposed entirely into F minor. A final brief link concludes the episode section.
