This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage is based exclusively on motivic material derived from the first subject and the connecting episode, with no reference to the second subject. Thematic content from the first subject and the transitional material is subjected to developmental treatment, implying fragmentation, sequential repetition, and harmonic recontextualization across various tonal areas, consistent with the function of a development section to destabilize tonal and thematic stability established in the exposition.
