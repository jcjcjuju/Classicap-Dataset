This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in A flat major (the tonic key), articulated through an initial pair of two-bar phrases followed by a four-bar phrase that concludes with a half cadence on the dominant. This entire thematic complex is then restated in a varied form, culminating in a perfect authentic cadence in the tonic. A connecting episode ensues, beginning with a two-bar phrase in B flat minor, which is immediately restated in A flat major; an imitative treatment of this material facilitates an enharmonic modulation to E flat major, the dominant key. The second subject unfolds in E flat major, commencing with a four-bar phrase that is subsequently repeated in varied form. This is succeeded by a second phrase of four bars’ duration, which likewise undergoes a varied repetition and concludes with a full cadence in E flat major.
