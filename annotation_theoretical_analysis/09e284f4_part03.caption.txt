This constitutes the final recurrence of the Scherzo’s primary thematic material followed by an extended coda. The section begins with a restatement of the opening Scherzo material, closely modeled on the initial presentation of Themes 1 and 2, though featuring minor textural alterations including an added left-hand trill and subtle rhythmic modifications. This leads into an extended cadential preparation characterized by a dominant pedal in the bass, frequent use of diminished seventh chords, and a dominant minor ninth chord that resolves via a perfect cadence. The coda commences with a modified statement of Theme 2 in the remote key of A major, incorporating chromatic inflections a semitone above or below the dominant scale degree. The rhythmic profile of Theme 2 then persists as the tonality shifts to B flat minor, followed by a chromatic modulation to D flat major. Subsequently, Theme 1 appears in D flat major, enriched with chromaticism—particularly intensified during a stretto passage preceding a perfect cadence. The movement concludes with a final iteration of Theme 2, again in D flat major, maintaining the chromatic embellishment around the dominant and briefly suggesting F major before closing with a definitive perfect cadence.
