This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, is structured as a twelve-bar sentence prolonged by cadential extensions to complete sixteen bars. Its cadential closure is undermined in the eighth bar by an accented auxiliary note that displaces the third of the tonic chord, thereby negating the sense of finality typically afforded by a perfect cadence and instead creating a state of harmonic and rhetorical suspense that compels continuation. The transition overlaps with the final bar of the first subject, forming an elision, and spans only three bars, concluding with a half-cadence in the tonic key. The second subject appears in the dominant key (G major) and is subdivided into three distinct sections. The initial section maintains a predominantly two-bar periodic structure, momentarily varied by a three-bar phrase that disrupts the established rhythmic regularity. The second section comprises two four-bar phrases: the first closes on a half cadence, while the second—presented as a varied repetition—concludes with a full cadence. The third section is a six-bar sentence, subsequently repeated with slight florid variation. A codetta follows, consisting solely of straightforward cadential extensions that reaffirm the dominant key. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
