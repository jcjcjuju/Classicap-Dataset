This constitutes the coda of the movement. It begins with a transposition of the second subject into the tonic key, presented with slight variation. The second subject, originally stated in C major, now appears in the home key, retaining its essential thematic identity while undergoing subtle alterations in texture or voice leading. This transposed and varied statement functions as a final thematic resolution before the closing gestures. The coda concludes with a distinct cadential passage that reaffirms the tonic key, providing structural closure to the movement through harmonic and motivic finality.
