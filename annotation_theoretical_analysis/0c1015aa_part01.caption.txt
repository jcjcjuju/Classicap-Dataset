This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of C major and is structured as an eight-bar sentence comprising two rhythmically identical four-bar phrases. This is followed by an episode built upon a dominant pedal point, which then incorporates a varied repetition of the initial four-bar phrase of the first subject and develops material derived from the fourth and fifth bars of that subject. The second subject begins in G major, the dominant key, and subsequently modulates to G minor; it concludes after a concluding eight-bar passage sustained over a dominant pedal point. A brief transitional passage leads back to the tonic key, culminating in a restatement of the first subject in its original form and key.
