This constitutes the exposition and subsequent modulatory and recapitulatory sections of a tonal fugue in D sharp minor. The exposition presents the subject in the alto in the tonic key, followed by a tonal answer in the treble transposed to the dominant, A sharp minor; a brief codetta ensues, after which the subject reappears in the bass in the tonic. The modulatory section commences with a chromatically descending bass line supporting florid upper voices, leading to an answer in the bass now restated in the tonic key. Episode I follows, effecting a modulation through G sharp minor and D sharp minor to A sharp minor. Stretto I then occurs with the subject presented successively in alto and treble in A sharp minor. A codetta introduces Stretto II, wherein the subject appears in all three voices—treble, alto, and bass—each slightly altered. Stretto III continues in F sharp major, with the subject in the treble and a corresponding answer in the alto. The first appearance of the subject by inversion occurs in the alto in F sharp major. Episode II modulates from D sharp minor to G sharp minor, after which the inverted subject appears in the alto in D sharp minor, followed by its inverted answer in the bass in the same key. A codetta precedes a series of further contrapuntal developments: an altered statement of the subject in the treble in D sharp minor, the inverted subject in the bass, Stretto IV featuring the inverted subject in the treble in D sharp minor, and Stretto V—a strict canon at the octave with entries spaced by a crotchet. Stretto VI presents the subject in all three voices by inversion. Additional codettas frame further entries, including statements of the subject in treble and alto in D sharp minor, leading into Stretto VII, which combines the subject in the bass by augmentation with an inverted answer in the treble in G sharp minor. Overlapping entries continue with the subject in the bass in F sharp major and the augmented subject in the alto in the same key, followed by a statement of the subject in the treble in B sharp major and an answer in the alto in G sharp minor. The anarecapitulatory section begins with Stretto VIII, presenting the subject in the bass and an altered form in the alto, both in D sharp minor, alongside the augmented subject in the tre
