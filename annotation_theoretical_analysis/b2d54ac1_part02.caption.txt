This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. It commences with a new melodic idea, distinct from the thematic material of the exposition. This is followed by a modulatory passage centered on the pitch D, over which a descending sequence unfolds. Initially, D functions as the tonic of D major; however, a modulation to G major reinterprets this same pitch as the dominant of the new key. The passage features characteristic figuration over dominant harmony, which drives the harmonic motion and prepares the return of the first subject in the tonic key at the onset of the recapitulation.
