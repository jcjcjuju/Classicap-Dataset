This constitutes the exposition of a binary-form prelude, comprising two large-scale periods that establish a tonal trajectory from the tonic to the dominant and back. Period I begins with thematic material that culminates in a perfect cadence in the relative major (G) at its midpoint, after which it proceeds through a supertonic pedal—functioning as the dominant of the dominant of the original key—followed immediately by a dominant pedal in the key of B minor. This harmonic progression firmly prepares and concludes the first period with a perfect cadence in the dominant minor. Period II introduces a new theme in the upper voice while the lower voice presents an inversion of the opening theme. This period features a structural division marked by a perfect cadence in the subdominant minor (A), after which the music transitions toward the tonic through a dominant pedal followed by a tonic pedal, thereby reaffirming the home key of E minor. The period concludes with a perfect cadence in the tonic, preceded by a striking deceptive cadence in which the dominant resolves deceptively to the major seventh below rather than proceeding by conventional voice-leading to the tonic.
