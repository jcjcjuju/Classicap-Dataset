This constitutes the development section of the movement. It commences with a third subject that unfolds initially in G major and subsequently modulates to D minor. The opening portion of this subject functions as a developmental treatment of the first subject, elaborating its motivic material through sequential or contrapuntal means. At the midpoint of this section, the thematic material acquires a distinct identity, diverging from its referential origins to establish an independent thematic character. The development culminates in a dominant pedal point passage, which serves a retransitional function by sustaining harmonic tension and directing tonal motion toward the imminent return of the first subject in the tonic key.
