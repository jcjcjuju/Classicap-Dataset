This constitutes the exposition of a prelude structured in three successive periods. The first period establishes a thematic idea derived from an arpeggiated figure and concludes with a cadence in the relative minor, featuring a strong deceptive cadence that substitutes the expected tonic chord with a supertonic harmony containing a flattened fourth scale degree. The second period is modulatory in function, employing sequential treatment: bar 10 forms a sequence with bar 9, and further sequential activity with shortened steps appears in the phrases corresponding to bars 11–12 and 15–16. The third period, though brief, continues the developmental trajectory initiated in the preceding material. Throughout, ornamental shakes are systematically applied to all longer note values—specifically dotted minims—except for two instances, serving to sustain tonal volume.
