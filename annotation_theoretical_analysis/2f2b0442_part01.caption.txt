This constitutes the exposition of a sonata-rondo form, presenting the principal subject and two episodic digressions. The principal subject, in the tonic key of E♭ major, is structured in ternary form: its initial four-bar phrase establishes the tonic melody, followed by a four-bar middle section containing a slight harmonic digression, and concluding with a literal repetition of the opening phrase, thereby reaffirming the tonic. This is succeeded by Episode I, cast in the relative minor (C minor) and also in ternary form; its first section introduces a new melodic idea that modulates to G minor and is immediately repeated in full, the middle section employs a modulating sequential passage that leads back to the final section, which restates the initial episode melody with modification to conclude with a full cadence in C minor. A brief modulating link follows, preparing the return of the principal subject, which reappears only partially in its second entry, retaining its tonic identity but in abbreviated form. Episode II then unfolds in the subdominant key of A♭ major, adopting binary form: its first part presents a melody that modulates to the tonic E♭ major and is repeated in full, while the second part returns to A♭ major through modulatory means. Another modulating link leads to a third, again partial, reappearance of the principal subject in the tonic. The movement concludes with a coda derived motivically from the episodes. Throughout, the underlying metric organization suggests a duple meter of two crotchets per bar, as cadences consistently fall on strong metric positions only under this reinterpretation, yielding regular eight-bar periods divided into balanced four-bar phrases.
