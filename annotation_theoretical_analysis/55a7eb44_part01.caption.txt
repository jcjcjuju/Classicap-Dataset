This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of A-flat major and exhibits an irregular phrase structure: its initial portion unfolds in a three-bar rhythmic pattern, while the latter portion adopts a two-bar rhythm, with a brief interpolation in four-bar rhythm. The subject is characterized by extensive use of inversion and imitation. An episode follows, constructed as a sequential treatment of the first subject; the initial segment of this episode is repeated in the treble register a twelfth higher. The second subject then appears in E-flat major, the dominant key, and is accompanied by a contrapuntal figure derived from the first subject. A brief transitional passage on a dominant pedal point ensues, which both modulates from the dominant back to the tonic and provides the thematic material for the third subject. The exposition concludes with a restatement of the first subject in its original tonic key.
