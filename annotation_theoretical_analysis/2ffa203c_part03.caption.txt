This constitutes a varied restatement of the movement’s initial large section, followed by a coda. The restated material retains the structural and thematic outline of the First Part but is presented with variation, preserving the original succession of thematic statements and episodes while altering surface details. It begins with an iteration of the first subject in D minor, maintaining its bipartite phrase structure: an initial four-bar segment concluding in the tonic, followed by a second four-bar segment that modulates through F major and resolves to A minor. This is succeeded by an episode built upon a dominant pedal point, which then leads to a restatement of the first subject in its original key, now adjusted to cadence firmly in D minor. The entire sequence is followed by a coda that synthesizes motivic material from both the first subject and the episode, thereby unifying the movement’s primary thematic elements in its concluding passage.
