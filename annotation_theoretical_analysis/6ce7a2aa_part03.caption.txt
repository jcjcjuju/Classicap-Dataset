This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in a varied form, firmly reestablished in the tonic key of A flat major. Following this, the connecting episode reappears but is significantly altered from its exposition counterpart: after its initial three bars, it diverges to modulate toward and conclude in the tonic key rather than the dominant, and its overall length is extended. The second subject then follows, now transposed from its original dominant key (E flat major) to the tonic key of A flat major, thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of recapitulatory practice. The movement concludes with a coda derived motivically from the first subject; this coda features pervasive syncopation throughout all but its final two bars.
