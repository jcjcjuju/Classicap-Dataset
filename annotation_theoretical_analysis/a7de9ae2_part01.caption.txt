This constitutes the exposition of a ternary-like thematic structure, articulated through three distinct periods. The opening section presents an impassioned Cantilena, underpinned by a characteristic harmonic ostinato wherein a single chord is reiterated three times per bar. This first period establishes a tonal trajectory through a sequence of cadential arrivals: it begins in the tonic and concludes its initial phrase with a cadence in the tonic key; the second phrase modulates to the subdominant minor; the third phrase arrives on the dominant minor; and the fourth phrase confirms the dominant minor (B♭ minor) with a perfect cadence. A subsequent modulatory period follows, prioritizing continuity over clear phrase segmentation and functioning as a transitional passage that destabilizes the established tonality. The final period serves as a coda, marked by expressive harmonic evasions—specifically, two successive interrupted cadences—that delay structural closure, thereby reinforcing the movement’s prevailing pathetic affect.
