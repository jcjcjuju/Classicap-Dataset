This constitutes the third large formal section of a sonata-rondo form, comprising a complete restatement of the principal subject in the tonic, followed by a new episode in the subdominant, a partial and texturally altered reprise of the principal subject, a transposed return of the second subject in the tonic, and a final, extended statement of the principal subject. The principal subject appears in full in the tonic key, concluding with a half-bar link that modulates to E-flat major. This leads to Episode III, which introduces a new melody in the subdominant key, culminating in a perfect cadence. A subsequent modulatory passage progresses through C minor, B-flat major, and E-flat major, ultimately returning to B-flat major for a half-cadence; within this passage, a real sequence spans the segment corresponding to the perfect cadence in E-flat major through the B-flat major phrase. A brief link then prepares the fourth appearance of the principal subject, which is partial and confined to its opening phrase, presented twice with modification: the first iteration places the melody in an inner voice beneath an inverted dominant pedal, while the second inverts the voice leading entirely. This partial statement concludes with a momentary modulation to F major at its cadence, followed by a descending triplet link that bypasses the original transition material and proceeds directly to the second subject, now transposed into the tonic key. After a two-bar link, the principal subject returns for a fifth and final time, presented as an exact replication of its initial statement with the addition of three concluding bars that reinforce the final cadence—an unusual feature in sonata-rondo form, where a fourth entry typically serves as the last, often in abbreviated form or absorbed into a coda.
