This constitutes the second subject of a sonata form. The section commences in B minor and modulates to F sharp minor, where the initial three-bar idea is restated in a varied form. This material is subsequently transformed again in G major, leading to a cadence in the tonic key of D major. The phrase concludes with an overlap into the return of the first subject.
