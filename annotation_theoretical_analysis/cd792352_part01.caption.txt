This constitutes the initial statement of the theme (air) in a binary form with repeated sections. The structure comprises two eight-bar sections, each subdivided into two four-bar phrases, and both sections conclude with a perfect cadence in the tonic key. Harmonically, the first section features a German augmented sixth chord in its sixth bar, whose roots are E♭ and A♭; the upper voice of this chord is theoretically notated as F♭ (enharmonically equivalent to the written E♮), which creates a voice-leading conflict in the form of consecutive fifths between the bass progression [F♭–B𝄫] and [E♭–A♭]. This same chord appears in subsequent variations with the B𝄫 respelled enharmonically as A♮.
