This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a five-voice fugue in C sharp minor. The exposition presents the subject and real answer in alternation across all five voices, beginning with the subject in the bass in the tonic key of C sharp minor, followed by a real answer in the tenor in the dominant key of G sharp minor. Subsequent entries include the subject in the alto (C sharp minor), a codetta confirming the tonic, an irregular answer in the second treble largely in F sharp minor (deviating from the expected dominant), and the subject in the first treble (C sharp minor), followed by another codetta. An incomplete counter-exposition ensues, featuring an answer in the tenor (G sharp minor), a subject entry in the tenor in F sharp minor, and a final answer in the alto in the tonic. The modulatory section commences with an answer in the bass in B major, followed by a subject in the alto in E major. Counter-subject I appears for the first time in the first treble, coinciding with a subject entry in the tenor in C sharp minor. Further entries unfold with increasing contrapuntal complexity, introducing Counter-subject II for the first time in the tenor in F sharp minor. The section features three episodes, each modulating between related keys—Episode I from G sharp minor to C sharp minor, Episode II from C sharp minor to G sharp major, and Episode III from C sharp minor to F sharp minor—with thematic material derived from inversions and sequential treatments of the counter-subjects. The recapitulatory section returns decisively to the tonic key of C sharp minor, initiated by an answer in the bass accompanied by Counter-subject II in the alto. This is followed by a stretto in which Counter-subject II appears successively in the second treble, tenor, and first treble. A codetta reaffirms the tonic with the subject in the tenor and Counter-subject II in the bass. The final measures feature sustained statements of Counter-subject II across all voices, culminating in a dominant pedal and a tonic pedal over which the subject is imitated in C sharp major. The movement concludes with a Tierce de Picardie, ending on a C sharp major chord. Throughout, the texture is governed by triple counterpoint, with Counter-subject II assuming primary contrapuntal importance in the latter half
