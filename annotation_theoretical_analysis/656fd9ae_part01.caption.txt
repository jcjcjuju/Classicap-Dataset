This constitutes the exposition of a prelude form, articulated through a succession of six distinct periods that establish thematic material and modulatory trajectory. The opening Period I presents a concise statement of Theme I over a tonic pedal, firmly confirming the tonic key of E♭ major, and concludes with a dominant pedal that prepares harmonic motion. Period II continues with the introduction of Theme II, which unfolds through a closely linked chain of suspensions generated by imitative counterpoint, ultimately cadencing on the dominant. Period III modulates predominantly to B♭ major—the dominant—and concludes on the mediant minor (G minor). This is followed by Period IV, which cadences in the relative minor (C minor). Period V then effects a further harmonic shift, culminating on the subdominant major (A♭ major). The final Period VI returns to the tonic through a tonic pedal and incorporates a coda that reaffirms E♭ major with a conclusive cadence. Throughout, the two primary themes are subjected to continuous interlacing, with Theme I reappearing in extended form from Period III onward and combined contrapuntally with Theme II in double counterpoint at the octave and twelfth.
