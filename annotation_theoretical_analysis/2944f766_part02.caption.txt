This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage commences with material derived from the codetta of the exposition, subjected to extensive imitative treatment across nearly every bar. Sequential writing governs much of the harmonic trajectory: a phrase in E minor is followed by a sequential repetition in D major, and a subsequent pair of bars is freely sequenced, facilitating a modulation to B minor. Within this key, the music briefly touches upon G major before arriving at a perfect cadence. A chord of the augmented sixth in B minor intensifies the harmonic tension preceding this cadence. The tonal focus then shifts definitively to G major, into which key the principal portion of the second section of the second subject—originally presented in the dominant during the exposition—is transposed. The remainder of the development draws its material from the transition section of the exposition, culminating in a literal restatement of its closing bars. Throughout this latter portion, the bass rhythm appears to be informed by motivic content originating in the codetta.
