This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. Following an initial two-bar prolongation of the dominant harmony, the section commences with multiple motivic references to the first subject. These references are succeeded by an extensive developmental treatment of the first three notes of the second bar of the first subject, which undergo considerable elaboration and transformation.
