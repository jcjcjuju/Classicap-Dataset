This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of F major and is structured as a twelve-bar theme divided into three distinct four-bar sections. A connecting episode follows, which initiates with a restatement of the opening two bars of the first subject, now altered harmonically through the introduction of D sharp—functioning enharmonically as E flat—to generate an augmented sixth chord; this augmented sixth resolves repeatedly onto the dominant of A, a harmonic progression noted as unusual in its preparation for the key of C major. The second subject then commences in C major, articulated through three successive four-bar phrases, the final of which modulates to G major. In G major, a passage unfolds that alternates between tonic and dominant harmony, leading into a new four-bar phrase that is subsequently repeated in variation within C minor. A diminished seventh chord rooted on F sharp introduces another four-bar phrase, after which a brief reference to the triplet figure from the second bar of the movement facilitates a full cadential closure in C major. The exposition concludes with a coda comprising a four-bar phrase that undergoes slight variation and rhythmic elongation upon its repetition; within this coda appears a distinctive harmonic sonority combining a supertonic-root diminished seventh chord with an inverted dominant pedal point. The entire exposition is marked for literal repetition.
