This constitutes a restatement of the primary thematic material from the first movement, presented in its original tonic key. The section comprises two distinct phrases, demarcated by a pause, which together articulate the first subject. The initial phrase culminates in a characteristic closing gesture whose final three notes undergo sequential repetition at varied pitch levels across the subsequent bars. This motivic treatment unfolds over a span of three iterations, each transposed to a different intervallic level, thereby creating a developmental inflection within the otherwise stable thematic recall. The section concludes with an abrupt metric and tempo shift to Presto, signaling a formal and textural transition.
