This constitutes the exposition, modulatory, and recapitulatory sections of a fugue in D major. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the bass in the tonic key of D major, followed by a real answer in the tenor in the dominant key of A major. A brief codetta ensues, after which the subject reappears in the alto in D major, answered by the treble in A major. A second codetta, containing allusions to the opening figure of the subject, leads to a further statement of the subject in the bass. The modulatory section commences with an answer in the treble in B minor, followed by Episode I, which modulates from B minor to G major and introduces new melodic material of structural significance. The subject then appears in the treble in G major, followed by another statement in the alto in D major; an incomplete answer follows in the bass in D major. The subject recurs in the tenor in G major, succeeded by an answer in the bass that closes in E minor. Episode II follows, modulating from E minor back to G major and employing the same material as Episode I, though with the melodic roles of treble and bass reversed. This is succeeded by a passage of free imitation based on the first limb of the subject. The recapitulatory section concludes the movement with a close in D major and a coda derived from motivic figures of the subject.
