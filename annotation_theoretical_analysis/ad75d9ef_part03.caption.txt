This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, presented without alteration. It is followed by the transition, which remains unchanged from its initial statement and consequently remains entirely within the tonic key, concluding with a half-cadence. The second subject, now transposed to the tonic key, is both lengthened and slightly varied; it is divided into two sections. The first section features a four-bar phrase ending on an inverted cadence, followed by a modified repetition of this material, and then a sequentially rising three-bar phrase leading to a half cadence, all underpinned by a dominant pedal in the tonic. The second section commences with a phrase that is contracted from four to three bars through immediate overlapping repetition; its responsive phrase is extended through sequential repetition and a cadential extension. The entire recapitulation is marked for repetition.
