This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata-form movement. The first subject returns in the tonic key of A major but is significantly abridged; it initially follows its original course for eight bars before diverging through a reworking that features an inverted dominant pedal. Over this pedal, the principal thematic figure appears simultaneously in direct form in the bass and in inversion in the treble, with an inner voice entering one bar later in strict imitation at the octave. A modified continuation—corresponding to material originally found at a later point in the exposition—then leads into the connecting episode. This episode retains the two-part structure of its initial appearance: its first segment undergoes harmonic and melodic alterations while preserving its essential character, whereas its second segment is an exact transposition of the original, raised by a perfect fourth, and concludes firmly in the tonic key. The second subject follows, now transposed from its original dominant-key presentation into the tonic A major, with only minor alterations to its texture or voice leading. The movement then proceeds into an extended coda constructed entirely from previously stated thematic material: this coda undergoes rhythmic expansion at one point, subsequently reintroduces the opening idea of the first subject, and later incorporates the second part of that subject (a passage omitted during the recapitulation proper). The movement ultimately concludes with a sustained tonic pedal point.
