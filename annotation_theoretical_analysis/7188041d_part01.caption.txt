This constitutes the first part of a simple binary form. It opens with a first subject firmly established in E minor, the tonic key. This is followed by a developmental section that departs from the tonic, engaging in harmonic and motivic elaboration. The first subject then returns in its original key of E minor, reaffirming tonal stability. The part concludes with a coda in the tonic major (E major), featuring a distinctive figure derived from the first subject, which is reiterated five times over a sustained tonic pedal point.
