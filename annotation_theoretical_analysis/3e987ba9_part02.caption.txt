This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is primarily based on motivic material derived from the first subject. It begins in C major and proceeds through a series of modulations, notably passing through D minor and G minor. The harmonic trajectory culminates in a dominant seventh chord of F major, which functions as a structural dominant preparing the return to the tonic. This dominant seventh is followed by a transitional link that smoothly reintroduces the first subject at the onset of the recapitulation.
