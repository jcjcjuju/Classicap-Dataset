This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section commences with an almost literal, though somewhat lengthened, transposition of the transitional passage from the exposition, beginning in D flat major and modulating sequentially through B flat minor, F minor, and C minor, culminating in a half-cadence in G minor that closes the first portion of the development. The remainder of the section is based on the opening phrase of the second subject: initially treated in its entirety, but from a specified point onward, the bold arpeggio figure is omitted, leaving only the quaver (eighth note) figure as the basis for further elaboration. This phrase is first presented on the tonic chord of G minor, modulating in its final bar to C minor via the dominant seventh, and is then repeated in that key. The subsequent eight-bar unit is repeated with inverted voice leading, now articulated over the tonic chord of C minor and the dominant seventh of F minor. A descending sequence follows, effecting modulations through E flat major and C minor. Later, another inversion of the parts occurs, accompanied by a modulation to B flat minor. The development concludes after a further re-inversion of the parts, arriving on the dominant seventh of B flat major.
