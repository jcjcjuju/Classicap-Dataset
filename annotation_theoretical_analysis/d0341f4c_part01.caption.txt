This constitutes the exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory section of a fugue in F sharp minor. The exposition begins with the subject stated in the tenor in the tonic key of F sharp minor, followed by a real answer in the alto in the dominant key of C sharp minor, accompanied by a countersubject in the tenor. A brief codetta leads to a third statement of the subject in the bass, now back in F sharp minor, with the countersubject appearing in the alto; this is followed by an extended codetta. The exposition concludes with a fourth statement of the subject in the treble, again in F sharp minor—marked as irregular—paired with the countersubject in the bass.  

The modulatory section commences with Episode I, which modulates from F sharp minor to C sharp minor. This is followed by an inverted answer in the alto in F sharp major, without the countersubject. Episode II then modulates from F sharp major to C sharp minor, leading to a statement of the answer in the treble with the countersubject in the alto, closing firmly in C sharp minor, followed by another codetta. The subject reappears in the tenor in F sharp minor with the countersubject in the treble, succeeded by a statement of the subject by inversion in the bass in F sharp minor, again without the countersubject. Episode III ensues, employing sequential modulation from F sharp minor to A major and returning to F sharp minor.  

The recapitulatory section presents the subject in the treble in F sharp minor, accompanied by the countersubject in the alto, and concludes the fugue with a Tierce de Picardie.
