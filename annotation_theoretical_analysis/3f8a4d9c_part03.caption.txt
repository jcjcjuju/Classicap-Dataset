This constitutes the da capo return of the Scherzo, followed by an extended coda. The Scherzo section is reprised in its entirety according to the initial binary structure, beginning with the first subject in C major and proceeding through its repetition, the developmental passage, the altered return of the first subject closing in the tonic, and the initial coda statement. Following this complete restatement, the movement concludes with a further coda beginning after the da capo repeat, which extends the final cadential material and incorporates thematic content introduced earlier in the development, specifically the figure first presented at the twentieth bar of the original Scherzo’s developmental section. This final coda serves to reinforce the tonic key of C major through conclusive harmonic and motivic closure.
