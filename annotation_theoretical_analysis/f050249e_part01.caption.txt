This constitutes the exposition and subsequent developmental and recapitulatory sections of a two-part real fugue in E minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the treble, concluding on the second quaver of the third bar in the tonic key of E minor, followed immediately by a real answer in the bass transposed to the dominant, B minor, accompanied by a counter-subject in the treble. The modulatory section ensues with Episode I, which modulates from B minor to G major; this is followed by a statement of the subject in the treble in G major with the counter-subject in the bass, then an answer in the bass in D major with the counter-subject in the treble. Episode II then modulates from D major to A minor, leading to a subject entry in the bass in A minor with the counter-subject in the treble, succeeded by an answer in the treble in E minor with the counter-subject in the bass. Episode III modulates from E minor through G and A to D minor, followed by a subject statement in the bass in D minor with the counter-subject in the treble, and an answer in the treble in A minor with the counter-subject in the bass. Episode IV modulates from A minor to G major, culminating in a sudden enharmonic reassertion of the tonic E minor. The recapitulatory section presents fragmented returns of the subject and counter-subject: first, a fragment of the subject in the treble and counter-subject in the bass in E minor; then a fragment of the subject in the bass in E minor; finally, the coda features an imitation of the concluding portion of the subject in the treble, firmly in E minor.
