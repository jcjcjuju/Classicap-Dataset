This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is worked almost entirely on the opening figures of the transition. It commences in F minor with an imitation—freely inverted—of the opening two bars of the first subject, and includes a cadence in A flat major that is founded on the final cadence of the same subject. From the subsequent passage, the five-note figure from the transition—now with the second half of the figure augmented—is distributed between the bass and the treble, with the bass ascending chromatically; this passage modulates through C minor to A flat major. The entire figure is then transferred to the treble, initiating a sequential harmonic progression that moves through F minor and D flat minor, ultimately arriving at E flat major, in which key the section closes on the dominant seventh chord.
