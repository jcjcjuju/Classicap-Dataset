This constitutes the principal theme of a rondo form. The section opens with an eight-bar melody firmly established in A major, culminating in a full cadence. This is followed by a new four-bar phrase that effects a transient modulation to E major, the dominant key, without achieving a full cadential confirmation in that key. The subsequent four-bar unit returns to material drawn from the initial melody, reaffirming the tonic key of A major. The section concludes with a three-note chromatic link—A♯, B, B♯—which functions as a transitional gesture, enharmonically preparing for the ensuing episode through its ascending chromatic motion.
