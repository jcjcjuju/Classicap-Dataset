This constitutes the exposition of a ternary-form prelude, articulated through three successive periods that establish and depart from the tonic key before returning to it. The first period establishes a modulatory trajectory culminating in a perfect cadence in the relative major, momentarily stabilizing the harmonic landscape before a brief inflection toward the subdominant at its close. The second period continues this harmonic exploration, concluding with a perfect cadence in the subdominant, thereby reinforcing the tonal instability initiated in the prior section. The third period initiates a reharmonization process, featuring a dominant pedal that intensifies harmonic tension before resolving into a tonic pedal in the final bars, which functions as a coda. This coda firmly reasserts the original tonic key through a conclusive tonic articulation, completing the tonal arc of the exposition. Throughout, the texture is shaped by four distinct motivic figures—among them a sustained note with a shake, a short arpeggio, an ornamental thirty-second-note gesture, and a four-note thirty-second-note figure—deployed contrapuntally and subjected to techniques such as free inversion, contributing to both coherence and contrast across the periods.
