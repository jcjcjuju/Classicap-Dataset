This constitutes the first part of a simple binary form. The section opens with a first subject in C minor, the tonic key, which modulates to conclude in G minor, the minor dominant. Following a double bar and repeat, an episode ensues, thematically derived from the first subject. This is succeeded by a varied restatement of the first subject, now remaining in the original tonic key of C minor and adjusted to achieve a conclusive cadence in that key. A second double bar indicates a repeat from the beginning of the episode, thereby encompassing the episode and the varied return of the first subject within the repeat structure.
