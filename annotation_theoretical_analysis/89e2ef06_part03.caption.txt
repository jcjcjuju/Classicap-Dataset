This constitutes a literal restatement of the First Part in its entirety. The section opens with the first subject in D major (tonic), presented in an eight-bar phrase that concludes with a cadence in A major. This phrase is immediately followed by a slightly altered repetition of the same material, transposed to the dominant key of A major. The combined sixteen-bar unit is then restated once more with slight alterations, maintaining the original tonal framework of D major for the initial phrase and modulating again to A major for its varied repetition. This is succeeded by a developmental passage structured as a sequential progression: an initial four-bar idea is first restated in A major, then transposed to B minor, culminating in a dominant seventh harmony. The section concludes with a modified and extended return of the first subject in the tonic key of D major, ultimately closing firmly in that key.
