This constitutes the Trio section in Simple Binary form. The first subject is presented in A minor (tonic) and concludes with a cadence in E minor. A development follows, elaborating thematic material through Bars 9–18. The first subject then returns in its original key, now adjusted to conclude firmly in the tonic A minor. Rather than employing a conventional repeat sign, the entire structure of the binary form is written out in full from Bars 25–42, incorporating a slight alteration at its conclusion.
