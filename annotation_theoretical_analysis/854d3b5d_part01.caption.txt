This constitutes the exposition of a modified periodic structure in which thematic material is presented and developed across multiple tonal areas without adhering strictly to sonata form. The section begins with the initial statement of Theme I in the tonic minor (B♭ minor), a theme notable for its distinctive character and extended duration of five bars. This theme is immediately subjected to contrapuntal elaboration through the introduction of Theme II—a brief, motivic idea in eighth notes—first appearing in the alto voice. Theme II rapidly assumes a structural role, functioning as episodic material both in its original and inverted forms, and frequently coexists with Theme I. An enharmonic modulation leads to a statement of Theme I in the dominant minor (F minor), maintaining motivic continuity while shifting tonal center. The section culminates in a perfect cadence in the tonic minor, thereby establishing B♭ minor as the primary tonality before the subsequent modulation to the relative major.
