This constitutes the final return of Section A in simple ternary form (ABA) with a coda. The first A section presents the main theme in B minor, characterized by a tonic pedal in the bass followed by a dominant pedal, frequent diminished seventh chords, and chromatic unessential notes such as E sharp and G sharp, without modulation. This is followed by an interlude remaining entirely in B minor, featuring dynamic contrasts between softer passages and occasional loud outbursts, and concluding with a perfect cadence. The B section, marked *Agitato*, begins with a sequential treatment of the main theme’s rhythmic and figural material, employing harmonic progressions that include iv–V⁷–I in multiple keys (D major, F sharp minor, A major), followed by another sequence utilizing a French augmented sixth and dominant chords leading through C sharp minor, C minor, and ultimately to B minor. It then moves to F sharp major (the dominant major), incorporating a flattened sixth (D natural) and cadencing perfectly twice before returning to B minor with a dominant pedal, chromatic inflections, and culminating in a dominant ninth chord; the remainder of the section unfolds over diminished seventh broken chords. The final A section restates the main theme identically to its initial presentation. The subsequent interlude, while initially resembling its earlier counterpart, is slightly altered and extended, growing increasingly agitated before resolving with a perfect cadence in B minor. The coda remains entirely in B minor, integrating chromatic elements, and features a dominant pedal, a perfect cadence affirming the tonic, a subsequent tonic pedal, and a final recurrence of the half-diminished seventh chord from the movement’s introduction, now with the tonic note in the bass.
