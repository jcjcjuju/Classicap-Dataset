This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject begins not in the tonic key but with a two-bar phrase in G minor, immediately followed by a two-bar phrase in G major; this four-bar thematic unit is then restated in C minor, which functions as the tonic key of the movement. A connecting episode ensues, commencing in A-flat major and modulating to F minor, within which a brief reference to the first subject appears in G minor, succeeded by a scale passage that prepares the arrival of the second subject. The second subject is presented in G major—the dominant major—rather than in the expected relative major (E-flat major). The exposition concludes with a two-bar transitional passage that leads to the re-entry of the first section.
