This constitutes the first part of a simple binary form. It opens with a first subject in D major, the tonic key, comprising two eight-bar sections: the initial phrase concludes with a half-close on the dominant, while the subsequent phrase provides a full close in the tonic. Following a double bar and repeat, the music proceeds to a modulating episode characterized by a three-bar subject that is answered at the fourth above, omitting the first note of the original subject. The first subject then returns in its original key, now varied and extended; its opening three bars are accompanied by an inverted pedal point on the dominant. The part concludes with a coda, after which a double bar indicates a repeat from the beginning of the episode.
