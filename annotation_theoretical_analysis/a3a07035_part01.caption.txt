This constitutes the exposition of a binary-form prelude, comprising two distinct periods followed by a coda. Period I establishes the tonic key and concludes with a cadence in the dominant minor (C♯ minor), thereby functioning as a modulatory antecedent period. It is internally divisible at its midpoint by a cadence in the relative major, reinforcing its periodic structure through tonal contrast. Period II begins by modulating through B minor and subsequently arrives at C♯ major—the dominant of the original tonic—before effecting a return to the tonic key, thus fulfilling the consequent function by resolving the tonal instability introduced in the first period. The closing coda draws motivically from the first and third thematic segments of the principal theme and reaffirms the tonic key with conclusive harmonic stability.
