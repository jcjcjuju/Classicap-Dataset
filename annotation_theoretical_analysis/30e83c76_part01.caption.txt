This constitutes the principal subject of a rondo form, functioning as the refrain. It opens with a melody firmly established in the tonic key of B flat major, presenting a balanced and lyrical phrase. This is followed by a transitional passage that modulates to the dominant key of F major, effecting a clear harmonic departure from the tonic. The section concludes with an exact restatement of the initial B flat major melody, thereby reinforcing the tonic key and completing the thematic statement with structural symmetry. The entire principal subject is demarcated by a double bar, signifying its formal closure.
