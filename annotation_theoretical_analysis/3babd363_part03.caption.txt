This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key without alteration, preserving its original thematic material and harmonic structure. This is followed by an unaltered bridge-passage that retains the transitional function and motivic content of its initial appearance, though now remaining within the tonic key rather than modulating to the dominant. The second subject is then restated in the tonic key, maintaining its tripartite division: the first section presents its characteristic triplet and small motivic figures, now transposed to the tonic; the second section develops these ideas through voice exchange and sequential treatment, as in the exposition but adjusted to the tonic; the third section reintroduces its opening figure with transient modulation, chromatic harmonies—including successive second inversions of diminished triads—and cadential extensions, all now grounded in the tonic. A double bar indicates a repeat of this entire recapitulatory span. The movement concludes with a coda consisting of two chords explicitly labeled as such by the composer.
