This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, unfolds as a twelve-bar sentence divided into two six-bar phrases: the initial phrase concludes with a momentary modulation to the dominant key, while the subsequent phrase achieves a full cadential closure in the tonic. A bridge passage follows, initiating in the dominant key and deriving its melodic material from the first subject. The second subject then appears in the dominant key (C major), establishing a clear tonal contrast. A brief link passage leads to a varied restatement of the first subject, which retains its original phrase structure and tonal orientation but incorporates slight ornamental or textural alterations.
