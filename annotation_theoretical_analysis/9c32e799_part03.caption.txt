This constitutes the recapitulatory section of a sonata form, beginning with the second subject transposed into the tonic key. The second subject is presented in three distinct subsections, maintaining structural and motivic fidelity to its initial appearance in the dominant key while now firmly rooted in the tonic. Following this, a connecting passage derived from the original codetta serves to reaffirm the tonic and prepare for the final section. The movement concludes with a coda based on the first subject, drawing thematic material from the opening thematic area to provide a cohesive and emphatic close in the tonic.
