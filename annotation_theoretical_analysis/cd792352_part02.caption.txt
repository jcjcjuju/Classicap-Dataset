This constitutes the first variation of a theme-and-variations form. The variation is characterized by the pervasive use of syncopation, which disrupts the regular metrical accentuation of the underlying phrase structure inherited from the theme. The rhythmic displacement permeates the texture throughout, reinterpreting the original melodic and harmonic framework through off-beat emphases and displaced rhythmic patterns, while preserving the fundamental harmonic and formal outline of the preceding air.
