This constitutes the recapitulatory section of a sonata-form movement, followed by a coda. The first subject returns in its original tonic key of A flat major, maintaining its characteristic construction with initial three-bar phrasing followed by two-bar units, and featuring abundant invertible counterpoint and imitative textures. This is succeeded by an episode closely modeled on the earlier transitional episode, though extended in length; whereas the initial episode concluded in B flat major, this variant modulates to and concludes on the dominant of the tonic key. The second subject then appears transposed to the tonic key of A flat major, accompanied by the motivic figure derived from the first subject. The movement concludes with a coda built upon a tonic pedal point, thematically derived from the first subject.
