This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with a new melodic episode that begins in D minor and modulates through A minor to E minor, in which key the majority of this episode is centered. Material from both the first and second subjects is referenced throughout. A passage in A minor and E minor (Bars 111–122) is derived from the preceding eight-bar phrase in D minor and A minor. This is followed by a dominant pedal spanning Bars 123–131, during which the parts undergo inversion starting at Bar 127; the rhythmic profile of this pedal passage is drawn from Bars 13–16 of the first subject. The subsequent music, leading to a full cadence in E minor at Bar 138, is taken directly from the second section of the second subject. Within this span, Bars 119–121 and Bars 134–135 feature the German sixth chord in E minor. Immediately following the cadence in E minor, the concluding bars of the exposition’s second subject are restated, now transposed into E minor, then D minor, and finally C major. This restatement is succeeded by a short modulating sequence constructed from the final four notes of that thematic material. The development concludes with an episodic passage that synthesizes rhythmic elements from the various sections of the second subject, frequently employing inversion of parts; this passage culminates in a chromatic run that follows a half cadence in G minor, the tonic minor key.
