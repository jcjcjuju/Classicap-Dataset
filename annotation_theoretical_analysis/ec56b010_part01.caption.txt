This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in F minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the tenor in the tonic key of F minor, followed by a tonal answer in the alto in the dominant key of C minor, accompanied by Counter-subject I in the tenor. This is succeeded by the simultaneous presentation of Counter-subject II in the tenor and a new statement of the subject in the bass, with Counter-subject I appearing in the alto, all returning to F minor. A codetta derived from Counter-subject I ensues, followed by an unusual third entry of the subject—rather than the expected answer—in the treble, supported by Counter-subject I in the bass and Counter-subject II in the alto, again in F minor. The exposition concludes with Episode I, which modulates from F minor to C minor, leading into a further subject entry in the tenor with both counter-subjects present.  

The modulatory section comprises six episodes, each separating individual subject or answer entries rather than groups of entries. Episode II modulates sequentially from C minor back to F minor, preceding a subject statement in the bass with both counter-subjects. Episode III effects a modulation from F minor to A-flat major, after which the subject appears in the alto in A-flat major, accompanied by Counter-subject I in the treble and only a fragment of Counter-subject II in the tenor. Episode IV modulates from F minor to E-flat major, introducing a real answer in the tenor without full statements of either counter-subject, though brief reminiscences appear. Episode V, involving all four voices, modulates from E-flat major to C minor, setting up a subject entry in the treble with both counter-subjects in C minor. Episode VI then modulates from C minor back to F minor, utilizing melodic material related to Episode I.  

The recapitulatory section presents the subject once more in the bass in the tonic key of F minor, accompanied solely by Counter-subject I in the treble, as Counter-subject II is omitted. The movement concludes with a coda featuring a Picardy third, ending on a major tonic chord.
