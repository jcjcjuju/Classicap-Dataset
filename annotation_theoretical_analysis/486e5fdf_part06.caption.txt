This constitutes the fifth variation of a theme-and-variations movement, followed by a coda. The variation is set in the tonic key of A flat major and spans the same structural duration as the original Air, preserving its underlying phrase organization without explicit mention of internal subdivisions or harmonic digressions. At its conclusion, the movement proceeds into a coda, which extends the formal boundary beyond the variation’s framework, providing a final cadential closure to the entire movement.
