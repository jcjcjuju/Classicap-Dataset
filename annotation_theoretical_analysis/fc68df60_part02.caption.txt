This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form, though it exhibits significant deviations from normative tonal practice. The first subject reappears not in the tonic key of C minor but in F minor, thereby undermining the expected tonal resolution characteristic of a conventional recapitulation. This is followed by a connecting episode that closely resembles its counterpart from the exposition, yet it is harmonically adjusted to modulate toward and conclude in F major rather than preparing the dominant. The second subject then enters in F major, again avoiding the tonic key; this choice continues the movement’s systematic displacement of thematic material into non-tonic keys. The section concludes with a transitional passage that functions as a lead-in to the subsequent movement, with no pause or cadential closure separating the two, thus contributing to the work’s overall formal irregularity.
