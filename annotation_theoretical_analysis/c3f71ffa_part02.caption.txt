This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is primarily constructed from two distinct motivic cells, both derived from earlier thematic material: the opening phrase of the first subject and a two-bar segment from the second subject (specifically Bars 41–43). It begins with the first subject’s initial phrase transposed into C major, which soon modulates toward F major. The ensuing harmonic landscape becomes tonally ambiguous, oscillating between F major and D minor. A dominant minor ninth chord in F major, presented in its last inversion, undergoes an enharmonic reinterpretation in the following bar as the first inversion of the dominant ninth in D minor; despite this notational shift, the chord resolves deceptively to the dominant seventh of F major. This dominant seventh is then enharmonically reinterpreted as a German sixth chord in E minor, thereby effecting a modulation into that key.

A twelve-bar sequential passage follows, built upon a four-bar pattern derived from the first subject and articulated with suspensions over successive dominant pedal points. This real sequence systematically progresses through E minor, A minor, and D minor, with the only alteration in intervallic quality occurring between the final two notes of the sequence. The latter portion of the development shifts focus to the aforementioned two-bar fragment from the second subject. A descending sequence emerges in which this material appears in the treble, accompanied by a bass line derived from the codetta’s bass figure; this sequence modulates from C major to A minor, culminating in a half-cadence in the latter key. In the closing bars of the section, the same motivic material is transferred to the bass register. The development concludes with a chromatic run that functions as a transitional link to the recapitulation.
