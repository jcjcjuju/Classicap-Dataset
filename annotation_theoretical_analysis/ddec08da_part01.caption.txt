This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of B♭ major and comprises two distinct sections: an initial eight-bar phrase followed by a nine-bar continuation. A connecting episode ensues, beginning with a four-bar phrase that remains in the tonic key before modulating to C major; this modulation is achieved over a pedal point and features a characteristic motivic figure. The second subject then appears in F major, the dominant key, completing the tonal and thematic layout typical of classical sonata exposition.
