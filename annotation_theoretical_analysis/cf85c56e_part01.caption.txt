This constitutes the exposition of a sonata-rondo form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of D major, comprising two four-bar sections: the first modulates to and concludes on the dominant harmony, while the second returns to and closes with a full cadence in the tonic. This is followed by an episode that initiates with a two-bar phrase in D major, immediately repeated three times with sequential modulation culminating in A major; in this dominant key, a new four-bar phrase appears, which undergoes partial repetition and terminates on a dominant seventh chord. The first subject then returns in its original tonic key, restating its thematic material without alteration.
