This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of C sharp minor, initiating with arpeggiated passagework articulated in a two-bar rhythmic pattern, which is subsequently condensed to a one-bar rhythm; this thematic statement concludes with a dominant pedal point that prolongs the dominant harmony. A connecting episode follows, derived motivically from the first subject, modulating from the tonic C sharp minor to G sharp minor. The second subject then unfolds entirely in G sharp minor—a departure from the conventional relative major—and is structured in two large parts, each beginning and ending in G sharp minor; the second of these parts is further divisible into two subsections. The exposition closes with a brief modulatory passage that prepares a return to C sharp minor for the repeat of the exposition and establishes C sharp major as the harmonic point of departure for the ensuing development section.
