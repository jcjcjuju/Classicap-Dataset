This constitutes the exposition of a ternary-like prelude form, articulated in three distinct periods. The first period establishes the tonic key of C minor and features a tonic pedal sustained through its initial phase; by its midpoint, the harmonic motion progresses stepwise toward the relative major, E♭ major, in which it conclusively cadences. The second period initiates a gradual return to the tonic key, effected through a dominant pedal that reinforces and consolidates C minor, culminating in a cadence on the dominant. The third period is structured around pedal points: it commences with a dominant pedal that persists through its first half, then transitions to a tonic pedal in its latter half, thereby reaffirming the home key through prolonged harmonic stasis. Throughout all periods, the texture is governed by a recurring four-note figural pattern characterized by a dissonant passing tone in the third position, which imparts rhythmic drive and motivic unity across the entire span.
