This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. It begins with a slight developmental treatment of the first subject, followed by a modified transition that now modulates to the tonic key rather than the dominant. Within this transitional passage, semiquaver figures derived by augmentation from the second subject appear, succeeded by demisemiquaver figuration directly borrowed from the second subject. The texture undergoes inversion and subsequent re-inversion across this span. The remainder of the section presents the second subject transposed into the tonic key of E flat major, featuring an interrupted cadence followed by a varied repetition of the preceding phrase, now concluding with a perfect cadence. A half-bar link then modulates back to the tonic, leading to a repeated statement of this entire recapitulatory section. Following the repeat, a coda ensues that recalls motivic material from the movement’s opening bars.
