This constitutes the first contrasting section (B) of a large ternary or rondo-like form, functioning as a developmental and thematic departure from the initial A-flat major material. The section opens with a pivot modulation from A-flat major to F major, mediated by the shared tone C, which serves as the third of the A-flat tonic triad and the fifth of the F major tonic. The main theme, introduced in F major, features gently syncopated rhythms and is harmonically enriched by appoggiaturas; it proceeds through sequential motion toward C major, where the tonic chord is ornamented by a diminished triad (F–A♭–B♮). This C major sonority is subsequently reinterpreted as the dominant of F minor, initiating a shift to the parallel minor. The thematic continuation in F minor briefly reverts to A-flat major before modulating through F minor to C minor, culminating in a perfect cadence with a tierce de Picardie—resolving deceptively onto a C major chord, which functions as the dominant of F minor. A dominant pedal in F minor underpins a passage that leads to an intensified restatement of the earlier dominant preparation, now transposed an octave higher in the right hand. This is followed by a more impassioned and texturally denser reprise of the F minor thematic material, which this time avoids modulation to C minor and instead remains grounded in F minor with added chromatic inflection. A sudden dynamic reduction introduces an interruptive episode beginning in D-flat major, which soon returns to F minor and settles on its dominant chord. A dominant pedal in F minor then supports a motive derived from earlier inner-voice material, preceding a modulation through A-flat major to C major. The section concludes with a full reprise of the main theme, now restated in its original form but transposed to begin in F major and end in C major, thereby reaffirming the tonal trajectory established at the outset of the B section.
