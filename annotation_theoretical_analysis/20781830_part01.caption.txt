This constitutes the exposition of a prelude structured in four distinct periods. The opening establishes the tonic key of E♭ major and prepares the thematic material. The first period introduces Theme I, which concludes with a perfect cadence in the dominant key of B♭ major. The second period modulates to the relative minor, C minor, and closes with a perfect cadence in that key. The third period begins in C minor and proceeds through a series of tonal digressions, including B♭ major, A♭ major, F minor, and a return to B♭ major before reestablishing the tonic. This period ultimately concludes with a perfect cadence in the mediant minor, G minor. The fourth period features a dominant pedal point over which two sequential phrases ascend, culminating in a coda that firmly reasserts the tonic key of E♭ major through a concluding perfect cadence.
