This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is primarily based on motivic material derived from the first subject and the connecting episode of the exposition. It opens with a statement of the first subject transposed to the key of E major. Later, at a significant structural point within the development, the initial portion of the connecting episode is reintroduced, now situated in the key of E-flat major. The treatment of these thematic elements reflects the developmental function of reworking and recontextualizing earlier material through modulation and textural variation.
