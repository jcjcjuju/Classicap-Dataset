This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory coda of a tonal fugue in B minor. The exposition presents the subject in the alto in the tonic key of B minor, followed by a tonal answer in the tenor in F♯ minor with a countersubject in the alto. A brief codetta leads to a restatement of the subject in the bass in B minor, accompanied by the countersubject in the tenor, and then an answer in the treble in F♯ minor with the countersubject in the bass. Episode I follows, modulating from B minor through F♯ minor and back to B minor, featuring a three-note fragment of the subject in the alto. The exposition concludes with another statement of the subject in the alto in B minor, now with the countersubject in the treble.

The modulatory section begins with Episode II, which modulates from F♯ minor through B minor to E minor and includes a three-note fragment of the answer in the tenor. This is followed by a full statement of the subject in the tenor in E minor, with a slightly altered countersubject in the treble. An incomplete stretto (Stretto I) ensues, with the subject appearing in the alto in F♯ minor without a countersubject, immediately followed by the subject in the treble in B minor. After a brief gap, the subject returns in the bass in B minor with the countersubject in the treble. This initiates Stretto II, a complete stretto in which the first part of the subject is imitated successively in the treble (B minor), alto (E minor), bass (A major), and tenor (D major), with partial countersubjectal material in the alto during the final entry. The answer then appears in the bass in D major with the countersubject in the treble. Episode III modulates from D major to F♯ minor, after which the subject is stated in the tenor in F♯ minor with the countersubject in the treble, then in the bass in E major with the same countersubject, and again in the tenor in B minor without a countersubject. Episode IV modulates from F♯ minor back to B minor and leads into Stretto III (incomplete), where the first part of the subject appears in the tenor in B minor and then in the bass in
