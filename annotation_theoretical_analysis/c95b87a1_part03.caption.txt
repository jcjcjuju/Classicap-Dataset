This constitutes the recapitulation and coda of a sonata-form movement. The first subject returns in varied form in the tonic key of B flat major. It is followed by an episode derived from the material of the original modulating episode, now reworked to conclude in the tonic key rather than modulating to the dominant. The second subject then appears in the tonic key of B flat major, but its concluding portion is significantly altered: instead of remaining in its initial key as in the exposition, it modulates to E flat major, thereby facilitating a brief transitional return of the first subject. A passage based on the first subject follows, functioning as a retransition that prepares the final statement of that theme. The first subject reappears once more in varied form in the tonic key. The movement concludes with a coda that introduces a new thematic figure at its outset and ultimately references the first subject in its closing gestures.
