This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of A major, spanning a compact four-bar phrase that begins and concludes on the dominant harmony. The connecting episode follows, initiating with a restatement of the opening two bars of the first subject before modulating to and remaining in the dominant key (E major); within this episode, the initial motivic figure of the second subject is foreshadowed from the ninth bar onward, and the passage culminates in an interrupted cadence. The second subject then unfolds in E major as a natural continuation of the episode, comprising a four-bar phrase followed by a five-bar phrase; notably, the final six bars of this nine-bar subject are constructed exclusively upon tonic and dominant harmonies of E major. The exposition concludes with a coda that commences with four bars of alternating tonic and dominant harmony in E major, succeeded by a double pedal point.
