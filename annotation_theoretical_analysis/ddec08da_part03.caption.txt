This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of B flat major, with its second section subjected to a highly elaborate variation in the bass. The connecting episode follows, transposed from its original presentation so as to modulate not to the dominant of the dominant but instead to conclude in the dominant key, thereby preparing for the return of the second subject in the tonic. The second subject is consequently restated in B flat major, affirming the tonic key. This is succeeded by a coda constructed from pre-existing thematic material: the initial passage of the coda reprises the dominant-pedal passage originally found in the development, while the subsequent passage draws from the first subject. The closing bars of the movement are sustained over a tonic pedal point, culminating in a plagal cadence articulated by subdominant harmony resolving to tonic harmony—a cadential formula commonly associated with codas in conjunction with a tonic pedal.
