This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key without alteration, preserving its original eight-bar sentence structure with a half-cadence concluding the first phrase and a full cadence ending the second. The bridge-passage or transition follows, now modified: while it begins identically to its initial appearance, it diverges by modulating in its second bar to B flat major, proceeds to G minor, and ultimately resolves back to the tonic key only in its final bar. The second subject then reappears transposed to the tonic key, slightly modified and expanded in length; it initially modulates to B flat major, wherein the repetition of its opening material occurs, before returning to the tonic, after which the closing material presents a slightly altered version of the corresponding cadential passage from the exposition. A brief codetta concludes the section.
