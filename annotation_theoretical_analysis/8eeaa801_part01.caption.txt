This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. It opens with a four-bar introduction sustained on dominant harmony, which functions as a preparatory gesture leading directly into the first subject in the tonic key of A major. The first subject is thematically unified and structurally bipartite. Its initial segment presents a distinctive motivic cell that serves as the primary generative material for the entire movement; this eight-bar phrase is immediately followed by an inverted and tonally adjusted repetition that concludes firmly in the tonic. The second segment introduces a new melodic figure in the treble, which is then imitated in an inner voice; the remainder of this section derives its content from the opening of the new figure and culminates in a restatement of the first part’s material in inversion, whose closing bars are treated in strict canon at the octave, ultimately resolving with a full cadence. A connecting episode follows, comprising two contrasting portions: the first develops a semiquaver figuration derived from the first subject and modulates from the tonic to E major, concluding on the dominant seventh of that key; the second portion introduces entirely new thematic material in two discrete phrases, the first spanning six bars and the second four, with the latter establishing E minor. The second subject then appears in E major and is explicitly derived from the opening of the first subject, presented with imitative counterpoint at the interval of a fifth. A brief coda ensues, featuring a bass motive that is subsequently imitated in the treble. The exposition concludes with a repeat directive, and a transitional passage later leads to the development section.
