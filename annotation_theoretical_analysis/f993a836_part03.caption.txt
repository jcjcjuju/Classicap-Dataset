This constitutes the final structural rotation of a rondo-like form, comprising a varied return of the first subject, a harmonically static episode, a further varied statement of the first subject, and a coda. The section opens with a considerably varied presentation of the first subject in the tonic key; despite significant melodic or textural alteration, the underlying harmonic progression remains identical to its initial appearance. This is followed by an episode that, while substantially varied in surface detail, adheres strictly to the original harmonic framework—an unusual procedure, as episodes typically involve harmonic innovation or modulation. A third varied statement of the first subject ensues, again preserving the tonic key and original harmonic structure. The movement concludes with a coda of notable interest, which draws principally upon motivic and thematic material from the first subject.
