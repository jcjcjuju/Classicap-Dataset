This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens in D major with a varied statement of the opening three-bar idea of the first subject, followed by its immediate restatement in the bass voice in F sharp minor. A further transformation presents the initial bar of the first subject in E flat major. Thereafter, the entire developmental process is generated from the triadic outline formed by the first four notes of the first subject. This motivic cell is subjected to sequential treatment through a series of chromatically shifting tonal centers, articulated as successive triads: C flat–A flat–F, D flat–B flat–G, D sharp–B natural–G sharp, E–C sharp–A sharp, and so forth. The section culminates in a cadenza built upon the dominant ninth chord of the tonic key.
