This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form, exhibiting an unconventional ordering in which the second subject precedes the first. The second subject returns in the tonic key, though its initial segment modulates to the tonic minor, concluding with a half-cadence in the minor mode approached via an augmented sixth chord—departing from its exposition counterpart, which closed with a perfect cadence in the major dominant. A brief caesura of nearly half a bar separates the two subsections of the second subject, with the bass providing a transitional link across this gap; the second subsection then continues in the tonic. Immediately following, the first subject reappears in the tonic, overlapping the conclusion of the second subject. The movement concludes with a coda that incorporates material derived from the exposition’s closing bars, now transposed into the tonic key.
