This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section commences with an extensive working out of the first subject, elaborating its thematic material through sequential treatment, harmonic instability, and motivic fragmentation. This developmental treatment occupies the initial portion of the section and explores remote tonal areas, consistent with the function of a development. It is followed by a transitional passage that systematically reestablishes harmonic direction, culminating in a dominant preparation that leads directly to the third thematic entry of the first subject. Throughout, the texture and harmonic language remain tightly derived from the exposition’s primary material, fulfilling the developmental role of thematic manipulation and tonal exploration prior to structural resolution.
