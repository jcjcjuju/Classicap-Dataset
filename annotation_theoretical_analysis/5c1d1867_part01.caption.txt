This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of D major and concludes with a full close on the tonic. Its initial ten-bar phrase is immediately restated an octave higher, followed by an eight-bar continuation that undergoes analogous treatment—repeated with slight alterations and rhythmic elongations—thereby extending the phrase structure before the final cadence. A substantial connecting episode ensues, comprising three distinct subsections; this transitional passage plays a significant structural role in modulating to the dominant. The second subject then commences in A major, the dominant key, overlapping seamlessly with the conclusion of the connecting episode. It is partitioned into two segments, both of which begin and end firmly within the dominant tonality. A brief transitional passage follows the second subject, leading directly to the development section. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
