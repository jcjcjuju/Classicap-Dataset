This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject appears in the tonic key of C sharp minor and remains unaltered from its initial presentation. The connecting episode that originally linked the first and second subjects is omitted. The second subject is transposed into the tonic key of C sharp minor, maintaining its structural division into two parts; however, one bar is excised in the recapitulated version, resulting in a slight contraction compared to its exposition counterpart. Following the second subject, a coda ensues, commencing with a thematic reminiscence of the first subject. This is succeeded by a passage featuring diminished seventh chords, which gives way to a recurrence of a portion of the second subject. The movement concludes with arpeggiated figuration that includes a Neapolitan sixth chord, ultimately resolving onto a tonic pedal point that reaffirms the home key.
