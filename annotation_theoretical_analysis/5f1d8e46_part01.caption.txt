This constitutes the exposition of a prelude in D major, structured as Period I. The section opens by firmly establishing the tonic key of D major. From the third measure, the harmonic motion progresses toward the dominant, culminating in a perfect cadence that confirms the dominant harmony. Thereafter, the music embarks on a series of modulations: it moves to E minor, then to B minor, followed by F-sharp minor, B major, and returns again to E minor, before ultimately resolving back to the tonic key of D major with a perfect cadence. The texture is built upon expanded arpeggiated figures that span a wide range of the keyboard, with the bass frequently leaping through partial arpeggios to its octave while the treble elaborates chordal components interspersed with passing notes. A brief imitative passage occurs, wherein material is transposed a fourth below, reinforcing motivic coherence within the harmonic flux.
