This forms the second variation of a theme-and-variations structure. The variation is built upon a fanciful melodic figure that elaborates the harmonic and rhythmic framework of the original Air. Within this variation, a distinct episodic passage is introduced, characterized by contrasting material that departs from the prevailing figuration. This episode recurs later within the same variation, creating internal symmetry and structural coherence through literal repetition of its content. The variation maintains the original meter and key, with the ornamental figure serving as the primary means of elaboration throughout the thirty-two-bar span.
