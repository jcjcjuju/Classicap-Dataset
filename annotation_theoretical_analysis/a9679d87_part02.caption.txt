This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens in C major with material derived from the triplet figuration of the transition, combined contrapuntally with a new treble figure that undergoes limited motivic development in the ensuing bars. A modulating sequence commences, based on the opening bars of the second subject, which is transposed successively over the harmonies of D minor, G minor, C major (functioning as dominant of F major), and F major. Following this, the music returns to D minor before resolving definitively to the tonic key of F major only in the final bar of the section. Within this harmonic trajectory, a slurred two-crotchet figure appears, directly modeled on a two-quaver motive from the second subject’s first section. The retransition features an implied enharmonic modulation: the supertonic chord of D minor with a flattened ninth is reinterpreted as the supertonic chord of F major with a flattened ninth, thereby facilitating the return to the tonic key. Throughout, the development alludes primarily to the transition and second subject, with only the final bars incorporating a brief reference to a motive from the first subject.
