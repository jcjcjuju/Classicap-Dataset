This constitutes the introduction to the movement, which is highly fragmentary in character and does not adhere to any prescribed formal structure. It comprises four distinct thematic segments, each presenting a unique subject and tonal center. The first segment is marked *Largo* and begins in F major, ultimately cadencing on a B major chord. The second segment, indicated *un poco più vivace*, is rooted in B major both at its inception and conclusion. The third segment, marked *Allegro*, unfolds entirely within G sharp minor. The fourth segment commences in A major and modulates to B flat major, employing the tonic A as a leading tone to facilitate the arrival at B flat. Throughout this introduction, brief allusions to the material of the first segment recur at the junctures between the second and third segments and again between the third and fourth segments. The introduction does not conclude discretely but instead overlaps with the entrance of the first subject of the ensuing section.
