This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage is thematically derived from the opening motive of the first subject, initially presented in the bass with accompanying semiquaver figuration adapted from the second section of the second subject. Textural inversion occurs successively, with the parts inverted, re-inverted, and inverted again across successive phrases. The harmonic trajectory begins in F major but immediately abandons this key, proceeding through a sequence of modulations encompassing D minor, B♭ major, G minor, C minor, D minor, and G minor, culminating in an inverted cadence in A major. This cadential resolution is not sustained; instead, its final chord is reinterpreted as the dominant of D minor, initiating a second developmental segment. This subsequent passage is constructed as a sequential treatment of the opening motive from the second phrase of the first subject, featuring free imitation between voices. It commences in D minor and continues through a series of fleeting tonal centers—G minor, B♭ major (articulated solely via its dominant seventh), C minor, E♭ major (also represented only by its dominant seventh), F major (likewise reduced to its dominant seventh), and G minor—before concluding on the dominant seventh of B♭ major, which functions as a dominant preparation for the ensuing recapitulation in the tonic key.
