This constitutes the second variation of a theme-and-variations form. The section is characterized by the prominent use of pedal point, which occurs repeatedly throughout. These pedal points function as sustained or reiterated tonal anchors against which harmonic and contrapuntal activity unfolds, creating textural and harmonic tension through dissonance and resolution. The underlying harmonic structure remains derived from the original Air, though the surface texture is transformed by the pedal-based elaboration.
