This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of B♭ major, initially unfolding over an eight-bar phrase that concludes with a cadence in the dominant key. This material is then restated in a varied form, now concluding in the tonic key, and is extended by two additional bars to achieve a full close in B♭ major. A brief modulating episode follows, introducing a new motivic figure in the tonic key and effecting a modulation to the dominant key, F major. The second subject then appears in F major, characterized in its final eight bars by arpeggiated chords: the right hand executes demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) figuration while the left hand presents the same harmonic content in quaver (eighth note) rhythms, with the first five of these bars structured over a tonic pedal point in F major. A transitional passage of imitation ensues, derived from the opening figure of the first subject, and serves to modulate back to the tonic key. The exposition concludes with a restatement of the first subject in its original tonic key.
