This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key without alteration, preserving its original thematic content and harmonic structure. It is followed by a bridge-passage or transition that has been transposed into the tonic key, thereby maintaining tonal stability rather than modulating to the dominant as in the exposition. The second subject then appears in the tonic key, fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of recapitulatory sections. The movement concludes without a coda; instead, two additional bars are appended to the second subject to reinforce the final cadence, providing structural closure through cadential emphasis.
