This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with material evocative of the initial gesture of the connecting episode from the exposition, culminating in a cadence in E flat major. This is followed by a five-bar continuation in the same key, which leads into an extended fugal treatment of a compound subject: its opening portion derives from the first three bars of the primary theme, while its latter portion is informed by the opening three-note motive of the second subject. Later in the development, a distinct passage undergoes sequential repetition across multiple tonalities. A brief allusion to the thematic material of the exposition’s coda appears, after which the fugal treatment of the primary theme’s opening returns, functioning as a retransitional passage that prepares the return of the first subject in the recapitulation.
