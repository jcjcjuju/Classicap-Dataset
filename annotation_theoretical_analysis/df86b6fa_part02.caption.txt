This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is primarily constructed from motivic material derived from the first subject and the final two bars of the exposition’s codetta, and it features extensive contrapuntal elaboration through canonical imitation. Notably, it includes varied treatments of the opening passage of the second subject. Specific instances of canon include a one-bar delay between treble and bass voices at the octave (bass imitating treble), followed by another canon with a half-bar delay in which the treble imitates the bass at the octave above. The texture is further enriched by inversions of voice leading. Harmonically, the development begins in A minor and proceeds through a series of modulations encompassing B-flat major, G minor, A minor, B minor, F-sharp major and minor, B minor again, E minor, and A major, ultimately arriving at D major. The section concludes with a transitional passage of descending semiquaver figures that functions as a retransition, preparing the return of the first subject in the tonic key. A double dominant pedal commencing in the latter part of the section underpins a chromatically ascending line, heightening harmonic tension before the resolution into the recapitulation.
