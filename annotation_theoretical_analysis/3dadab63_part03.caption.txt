This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form, followed by a cadenza and coda. The principal subject returns in the tonic key, presented in its entirety. It is succeeded by a substantially expanded transition that retains its structural role but extends significantly in length. The second subject then reappears transposed to the tonic key, where it is slightly lengthened and varied in its presentation. A pedal passage in the tonic follows, derived motivically from the earlier link section and functioning as a bridge to the cadenza. An unusual feature for a solo piano sonata, the cadenza is interpolated after the recapitulation, following conventionally after a cadential 6/4 (Ic) chord. This cadenza draws primarily upon the two-bar opening motive of the principal subject and incorporates figures from the aforementioned link passage, which is quoted in full within the cadenza. The cadenza concludes with virtuosic scale passages that lead into a partial fourth statement of the principal subject in the tonic, which seamlessly merges into the coda. The coda begins with a varied repetition of a fragment from the second subject and ultimately concludes with material evocative of the principal subject.
