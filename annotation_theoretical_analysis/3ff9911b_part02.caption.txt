This constitutes the development section of the movement, structured as a hybrid form that synthesizes elements of both ternary and binary design. The episode is set in the tonic major and commences with a new melodic idea that modulates from A major to E major (the dominant). This initial section is followed by an eight-bar sequential passage that modulates through B minor before returning to A major. The final portion of the development presents a modified recurrence not of an entire phrase but of the second of the four phrases from the exposition’s principal subject; this reprise is adapted to conclude with a full cadence in the tonic. The sense of formal return is reinforced by the reestablishment of the tonic pedal point—a feature associated with the first three phrases of the original exposition but absent in its fourth phrase. Despite its ostensibly novel material, the episode exhibits a close motivic relationship with the earlier modulating passage (Episode I), particularly evident in the correspondence between specific phrase structures.
