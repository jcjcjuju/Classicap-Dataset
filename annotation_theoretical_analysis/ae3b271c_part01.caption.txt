This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in E flat major, the tonic key, and is structured as a compound sentence: it opens with a four-bar phrase concluding on the dominant, which is then repeated in an altered version that resolves to the tonic, thereby completing an eight-bar sentence. This is followed by a second eight-bar sentence, which is immediately repeated in its entirety. An episode follows, derived motivically from the opening of the first subject. The second subject then appears in B flat major, the dominant key, and is divided into two distinct parts, each beginning and ending firmly within that key. A subsequent episode is built upon a dominant pedal point and effects a modulation back to the tonic key. The first subject returns in its original tonic key, now restated in full. The exposition concludes with a transitional passage constructed from material of the first subject, cast in the tonic minor (E flat minor) and modulating to G flat major, thereby preparing the harmonic ground for the ensuing development section.
