This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of E flat major, presented initially with a new accompanimental texture; its subsequent statement in the bass retains thematic identity but features yet another distinct accompaniment, and the third iteration found in the exposition is omitted. The connecting episode that follows is structurally identical to its counterpart in the exposition, though it has been reharmonized to modulate to the tonic rather than to the dominant. The second subject then appears in the tonic key of E flat major, preserving its original phrase structure and thematic content through literal transposition, with the sole modification being a two-bar extension. The movement concludes with a Coda marked “Poco Andante,” which is thematically derived from the first subject.
