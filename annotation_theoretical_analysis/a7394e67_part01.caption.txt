This constitutes the exposition of a real fugue in E major. The subject is first presented in the alto voice in the tonic key, concluding on the first semiquaver of beat three. A real answer follows immediately in the treble, entering slightly before the subject’s completion, accompanied by a counter-subject in the alto and transposed to the dominant key of B major. The subject then recurs in the bass, now back in E major, with the counter-subject appearing in the treble. A brief codetta ensues, after which the subject reappears in the treble with the counter-subject in the bass, both in the tonic. This is followed by an answer in the alto with the counter-subject in the treble, and finally an answer in the bass, again paired with the counter-subject in the treble. The counter-subject is consistently short, aligning with only a portion of the subject, and remains absent in later sections of the movement. The exposition establishes the fugal material through systematic voice entries and tonal alternation between tonic and dominant, characteristic of a "real" fugue with a real answer.
