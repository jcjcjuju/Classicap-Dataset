This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of F major and is structured as a four-bar phrase that initiates in the bass in fugal style, with an answer at the octave appearing in the treble. This is followed by a connecting episode that modulates to the dominant key of C major; this episode is thematically derived from the first subject, upon which it is founded. The second subject then appears in the dominant key of C major and is characterized by its construction over a pedal point. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
