This constitutes the recapitulation and coda of a sonata-form movement. The first subject returns in the tonic key of E minor, though only its first part is presented; this reprise features double counterpoint, wherein the original bass line—slightly altered—is now placed in the treble. The second part of the first subject, which in the exposition was built upon a dominant pedal point, is omitted entirely. The connecting episode follows, constructed from the same thematic material as in the exposition but transposed: it begins in C major, following a brief modulation into that key, and ultimately resolves back to the tonic key of E minor. The second subject then reappears, transposed from its original B minor (dominant minor) to the tonic E minor, thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution expected in the recapitulation; aside from these necessary transpositional adjustments, the second subject remains largely unaltered. The movement concludes with a coda that commences with a perfect cadence in the tonic, followed by a passage in contrary motion; the bass line of this latter passage derives from material previously heard in the second subject’s closing bars.
