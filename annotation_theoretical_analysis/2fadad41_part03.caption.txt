This constitutes a literal da capo reprise of the First Part, thereby restating its complete formal and harmonic design. The section opens with the first subject in F minor (tonic), presented in a four-bar phrase that is immediately repeated in the relative major, A♭ major. This is followed by a concluding four-bar phrase that modulates back toward the tonic, with the right-hand material of the initial phrase undergoing inversion in the subsequent phrase. The final two bars of this closing phrase are repeated, reinforcing the cadential articulation. A development section then ensues, which explicitly references motives from the first subject through fragmentation and contrapuntal manipulation. The first subject returns in a varied and shortened form, now conclusively cadencing in the tonic key of F minor rather than in the relative major as in its initial appearance. The entire structure is bounded by a double bar and repeat sign, though the da capo instruction supersedes literal repetition in performance.
