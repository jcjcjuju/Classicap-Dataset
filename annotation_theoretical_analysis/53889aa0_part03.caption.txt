This constitutes the recapitulation and coda of a sonata-form movement. The first subject returns in the tonic key but in an incomplete form; its final phrase (corresponding to the original Bars 10–14) is presented in inversion and incorporates accompanimental triplets of semiquavers derived from the second section of the second subject, thereby synthesizing material from both thematic groups. A brief transition follows, leading to the second subject, which is now transposed to the tonic key and also appears with its opening bars inverted. This second subject is structured in two sections, the first of which recalls motivic content from the exposition while the second retains its original internal organization. The movement concludes with a coda comprising cadential repetitions: it begins with a three-bar phrase culminating in an interrupted cadence, followed by a final phrase initially three bars in length but extended to five through further cadential repetition. Within this coda, transient modulations momentarily suggest G minor, E flat major, and C minor, enriching the harmonic closure.
