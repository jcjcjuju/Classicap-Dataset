This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The material is almost entirely derived from bars 7–10 of the first subject, subjected to extensive motivic manipulation and sequential treatment. From the midpoint of the section, double counterpoint at the octave is employed continuously, generating contrapuntal complexity through invertible voice leading. While the second subject is otherwise absent throughout the development, its second part reappears in a varied form near the conclusion, presented successively in B major, B minor, and D major, thereby introducing tonal instability and thematic recall in rapid succession. The section culminates on a dominant seventh harmony, preparing the return to the tonic key for the recapitulation.
