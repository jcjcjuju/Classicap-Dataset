This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in a varied presentation in the tonic key of E major. Following this, the connecting episode—equal in length to its initial appearance—begins with material derived from the opening of the first subject, now recontextualized through variation and transposed into the key of C major; this episode subsequently modulates to the dominant key via an augmented sixth chord. The second subject then appears transposed into the tonic key of E major, preserving its thematic content while fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of recapitulation; within this section, consecutive fifths occur. The movement concludes with a coda based on material previously heard in the exposition’s coda, thereby reinforcing structural coherence through thematic recall.
