This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key, featuring a dominant pedal point beneath Bars 9–13 and an inversion of the upper parts between Bars 9–11 and their subsequent repetition. The transition overlaps with the close of the first subject, initiating with a restatement of its opening motive an octave higher, followed by a further iteration of the same motive in the bass alone over the dominant chord of E-flat major. A new melodic idea then emerges in E-flat major—the relative major—leading via a brief link into the second subject, which remains in this key. The second subject unfolds in two sections: the first exhibits part inversion with hand-crossing in two passages, incorporates a sequential repetition of its initial phrase, and includes an Italian sixth chord in F minor appearing twice; the second section is motivically linked to the corresponding portion of the second subject in the Finale of the same sonata. The exposition concludes with an overlapping link derived from the first subject, which modulates in its final bar to facilitate both the repeat of the exposition and the subsequent entrance into the development.
