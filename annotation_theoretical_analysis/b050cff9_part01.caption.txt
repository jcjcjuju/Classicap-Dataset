This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject unfolds as an eight-bar sentence in the tonic key, structured as two phrases: the initial four-bar phrase concludes with a half-cadence, while the subsequent four-bar phrase—presenting a modified repetition of the first—resolves with a full cadence. A bridge-passage or transition follows, remaining within the tonic key throughout and culminating in a half-cadence on the dominant; this dominant functions enharmonically as the tonic of the new key, thereby facilitating the entrance of the second subject. Within the transition, a varied repetition occurs, elaborating upon its preceding material. The second subject appears in the dominant key (C major) and is constructed as a single sentence significantly extended through cadential repetition. Its texture features a transfer of the melodic line to the tenor register beneath a sustained trill on the dominant in the treble. Further cadential repetitions ensue, each introducing variation: one commences anew while restating the responsive phrase, and another presents an even more substantially modified version of the same. Incidental modulations to D minor occur during these repetitions, and a free inversion of the thematic material is employed. The exposition concludes with a codetta, after which a double bar and repeat sign indicate that the entire exposition is to be repeated—a practice noted as atypical for slow movements cast in unabridged sonata form.
