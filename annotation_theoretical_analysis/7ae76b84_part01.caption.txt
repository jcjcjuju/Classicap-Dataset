This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, is structured as an eight-bar sentence extended to ten bars through the repetition of its third two-bar segment. A perfect cadence concludes the initial four-bar phrase, yet its effect is one of expectancy rather than closure, due to the voicing of the tonic chord—specifically, the note sounding in the highest part—and its placement off the strong metric accent; only the final cadence of the sentence achieves a sense of complete rest. The transition commences with a repetition of the opening figure of the first subject and is principally derived from this motive. A varied form of the figure, slightly altered at each iteration, appears three times consecutively, followed by an augmented version of its first four notes presented twice. This passage modulates to F major—the dominant key—by its second bar and concludes with a half-cadence in that key. The second subject unfolds in three distinct sections, all in F major. The first section is a sixteen-bar sentence organized in four-bar phrases; its midpoint cadences on a half-cadence, after which the third phrase restates the material of the first with minor alterations, and the fourth phrase is adjusted to lead to a conclusive perfect cadence. The second section begins as an eight-bar sentence but is prolonged to twelve bars by a full cadential repetition of its after-phrase, notable for an inversion of parts at the onset of this repetition. The third section comprises a nine-bar sentence: a four-bar phrase ending with a perfect cadence is repeated and extended to five bars, not through rhythmic augmentation but by doubling the duration of each of the two chords in the fifth bar of the repeated phrase. The exposition concludes with a codetta whose opening figure—repeated once—is an inversion of the augmented motive previously heard in the transition. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
