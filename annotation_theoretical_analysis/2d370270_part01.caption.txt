This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of C minor and is harmonically restricted to tonic and dominant harmonies; it opens with two four-bar phrases, which undergo rhythmic compression into two-bar phrases in its latter portion. A connecting episode follows, introduced by a single bar on E♭, and features a melodious phrase that is sequentially restated three times, each iteration grounded in the tonic and dominant harmonies of A♭ major, F minor, and D♭ major, respectively. This is succeeded by a modulatory passage leading to an eight-bar pedal point on B♭ in the bass; within this pedal section, Bar 45 presents a concentrated succession of all three standard forms of the augmented sixth chord—French, German, and Italian. The second subject then appears in E♭ major, structured in regular four-bar phrases, and includes a brief reminiscence of the first subject following a 6/4 chord; it concludes with a full cadence in E♭ major. The exposition closes with a coda derived motivically from the closing portion of the connecting episode. The entire exposition is marked for literal repetition.
