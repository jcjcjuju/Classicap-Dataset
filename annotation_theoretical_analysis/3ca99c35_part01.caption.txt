This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of E major, initiated by a four-bar phrase that concludes with an authentic cadence in the tonic. This is followed by a parallel four-bar phrase that modulates to the dominant key of B major, thereby fulfilling the tonal trajectory typical of classical expositions. The phrase structure is then disrupted by an incipient continuation that is abruptly truncated, giving way to an episode. This episode opens with a dissonant sonority—an inversion of the dominant minor ninth—and quickly assumes the character of a cadenza after its initial two bars; it originates in C♯ minor and ultimately cadences in B minor. The first subject subsequently returns in a varied guise, now transposed to B major, where its original treble motive from the opening is rearticulated in the bass. A new melodic idea is introduced over the first subject’s rhythmic figure, beginning in G♯ minor. Later, an inverted dominant pedal point establishes harmonic tension, culminating in a modified restatement of the first subject above a scalar bass line, now adjusted to resolve conclusively in the tonic key of E major; however, this anticipated perfect cadence is thwarted by an abrupt interpolation of a new episode.
