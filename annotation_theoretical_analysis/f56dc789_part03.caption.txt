This constitutes a literal reprise of the Menuetto, presenting the complete first part of the movement in its original form. It begins with the first subject in B-flat major, followed by the episode, a varied return of the first subject in the tonic key, and concludes with the coda. The section adheres to simple binary form and includes the prescribed repeats as indicated in the original statement.
