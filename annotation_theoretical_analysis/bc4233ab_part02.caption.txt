This constitutes the Trio section in simple binary form. The first section presents a First Subject in E♭ major that modulates to conclude on an authentic cadence in B♭ major, the dominant. This section is followed by a developmental passage that initiates a process of harmonic and motivic elaboration. The final section restates the First Subject in its original key of E♭ major, now modified to achieve a conclusive authentic cadence in the tonic. The entire binary structure is framed by repeat signs, with the second half—encompassing both the development and the altered return of the First Subject—designated for repetition.
