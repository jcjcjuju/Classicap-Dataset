This constitutes the exposition of a sonata-rondo form. It opens with the first subject in the tonic key of G major, presenting a thematic idea later reused by Beethoven in his Septet. This is followed by an episode comprising new material: it begins with a four-bar phrase in the tonic, succeeded by another four-bar phrase in the dominant key, culminating in a cadence in A major. Within this episode, motivic inversion occurs as the bass line of the initial phrase reappears in the treble register. At the onset of the dominant-key phrase, a new figuration is introduced over a pedal point on the dominant of D major, and the episode ultimately concludes in the key of D major. A brief connecting passage then modulates back to the tonic key. The first subject subsequently returns unaltered in G major, reaffirming the tonic and completing the primary thematic cycle of the exposition.
