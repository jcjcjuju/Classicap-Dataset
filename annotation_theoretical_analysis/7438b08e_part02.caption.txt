This constitutes the second part of a binary form, functioning as a contrasting middle section. It presents a subject in G major, the tonic key of this section. The initial sixteen-bar phrase concludes on the chord of D major, which functions as the dominant of G major. This phrase is immediately followed by a varied repetition of itself, now slightly altered in its details and extended to cadence not on a simple dominant chord but on the dominant seventh of D major, thereby implying a modulation toward A major or reinforcing D as a local dominant. The entire section is bounded by a double bar, signaling formal closure.
