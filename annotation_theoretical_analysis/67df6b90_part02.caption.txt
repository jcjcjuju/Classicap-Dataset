This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is preluded by a repetition of the three-note figure that concludes the second subject. It opens with a reference to the first phrase of the first subject, initiating the developmental process through motivic recall. At a later point, new material is introduced in the form of a chromatic passage, which functions as a transitional device leading into a development of the second phrase of the first subject. The entire development culminates in the tonic key, preparing for the subsequent recapitulation.
