This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section commences in G minor and incorporates motivic material derived from both the first and second subjects of the exposition. The developmental process unfolds through sequential treatment and harmonic recontextualization of these thematic elements. The section culminates in a dominant seventh harmony, which is prepared and sustained by a fourteen-bar dominant pedal point, creating harmonic tension that drives toward the imminent recapitulation.
