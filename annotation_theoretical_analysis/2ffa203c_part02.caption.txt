This constitutes the second part of a ternary or rounded binary structure, functioning as a contrasting middle section. It begins with a transposition of the first subject into D major, which subsequently modulates to conclude in A major. This is followed by an episode spanning four bars, characterized by motivic or harmonic material distinct from the first subject. The part then presents a further statement of the first subject, now in its original D minor key but significantly shortened and altered to cadence firmly in D major. The entire section from the episode onward is repeated, reinforcing the structural symmetry and harmonic trajectory of the part.
