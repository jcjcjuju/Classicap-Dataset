This constitutes a restatement of the main thematic material in the tonic key, functioning as a final structural return of the air without internal repetitions. The phrase structure adheres to the original design of two eight-bar sections, each comprising two four-bar phrases that conclude with perfect cadences on the tonic chord. However, the expected final tonic resolution is disrupted by the substitution of the closing chord with the third inversion of a minor ninth chord. This dissonant sonority interrupts the cadential closure and is immediately repeated, serving a transitional function that anticipates the ensuing movement in F minor.
