This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. It opens with a first subject in the tonic key of D major, constructed over a sustained tonic pedal point. The thematic material is organized into two four-bar phrases, each immediately repeated: the initial phrase undergoes literal repetition, while the second is varied upon its return. An episode follows, characterized by arpeggiated figuration that modulates from the tonic D major to E major. The second subject then appears in A major, the dominant key, and is structured as a four-bar period that is subsequently repeated with variation; the remainder of the subject consists of an extension derived from the final two bars of this period. The second subject exhibits imitative counterpoint, with its opening gesture introduced in the treble and successively answered at the octave below by the alto and bass voices. A transitional passage ensues, functioning as a retransition that leads back to the tonic key and prepares for the return of the first subject. This return presents the first subject once again in its original key, now subtly altered by the addition of a brief ornamental figure in the treble voice at the point where rests had previously occurred.
