This constitutes the exposition of a binary-structured section exhibiting traits of early sonata form. It opens with a thematic division into two distinct phrases: the first phrase, Part i(a), presents an eight-bar period firmly rooted in E flat major (the tonic key), while the second phrase, Part i(b), continues for another eight bars and modulates to B flat major, the dominant. This bipartite thematic organization within the opening section reflects a transitional stage in formal development, characteristic of the evolution from smaller binary forms toward the more expansive sonata principle. Following a double bar repeat, the music proceeds to a brief developmental passage (Part ii) spanning eight bars, which engages in slight motivic elaboration without establishing a stable new key area. The section concludes with a recapitulatory statement (Part iii) in which both thematic phrases—originally presented in tonic and dominant—are now restated entirely within the tonic key of E flat major, thereby achieving tonal resolution. This final statement is also followed by a double bar repeat.
