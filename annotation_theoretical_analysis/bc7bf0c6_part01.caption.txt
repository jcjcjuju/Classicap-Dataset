This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of G major and comprises two four-bar sections; the initial phrase is immediately followed by its repetition transposed an octave higher, after which the second four-bar section ensues. A connecting episode follows, beginning with a reference to the second section of the first subject and remaining primarily in the tonic key, though it features a transient modulation to the dominant at the onset of a dominant pedal point, which persists through the remainder of the episode. The second subject appears in the dominant key of D major and is structured in two parts: the first part concludes in A major and is subsequently repeated with an altered cadence that secures closure in D major; the second part both begins and ends firmly in the dominant key. The exposition concludes with a coda derived motivically from the connecting episode figure. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
