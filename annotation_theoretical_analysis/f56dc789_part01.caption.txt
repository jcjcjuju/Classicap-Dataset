This constitutes the first section of a Simple Binary form, functioning as the Menuetto proper. It opens with a First Subject in B♭ major, the tonic key, which establishes the primary thematic material. This subject is followed by an Episode that departs from the initial thematic and harmonic content. The First Subject then returns in a varied form, restated in the original tonic key of B♭ major, thereby fulfilling the binary design through thematic return after contrast. The section concludes with a Coda that provides a cadential closure to the entire structure. The internal repeat scheme directs a return to the beginning of the Episode upon the second traversal, resulting in the omission of the initial statement of the First Subject during the repeat, while the varied return of the First Subject and the Coda are retained.
