This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key and begins with a six-bar phrase extended through sequential imitation over a tonic pedal. A responsive phrase follows, initially stated as a three-bar phrase that concludes with an evaded cadence due to the omission of the final chord; this phrase is then repeated with the cadential chord restored, culminating in a full cadence in the tonic. The transition is characterized by continuous triplet figuration and modulates to the dominant, ultimately arriving at a half cadence in F major (the tonic of the movement). Within this transition, a sequential passage occurs over a chromatically descending bass. The second subject appears in C major (the dominant) and is structured in two distinct sections, each concluding with a perfect cadence. It opens in the bass with an arpeggiated figure moving in inverse direction relative to the opening arpeggio of the first subject. The initial phrase of the first section spans four bars and alternates between tonic and dominant harmonies, with tonic predominance, ending on a half cadence; this phrase is immediately repeated with inverted harmonic voicings and concludes with a full cadence. A real sequence follows, based on a chromatically rising bass, largely comprising four bars of exact transposition, and incorporating triplet figures in the treble derived from the transition. The second section introduces a new semiquaver figure, which undergoes sequential treatment, and its first phrase closes with a perfect cadence; this phrase is then extended and varied in its repetition. The exposition concludes with a codetta that employs the opening motive of the second subject, subjected to partial diminution. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
