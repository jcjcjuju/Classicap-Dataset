This constitutes the exposition and partial recapitulation of a sonata-form structure in F minor. The first subject comprises two four-bar phrases, both concluding with a cadence in the dominant major (C major). A developmental section follows, initiated by an eight-bar sequential passage that modulates to A♭ major—the relative major—employing rhythmic inversion derived from the latter half of the first subject. Within this relative major, a new thematic figure emerges, directly modeled on material from the third and fourth bars of the opening subject. Later, a transformed reference to the initial phrase appears with altered accentuation, succeeded by the previously introduced figure now transposed into the tonic key. This leads to a restatement of the first subject, again with modified accentuation as heard in the developmental treatment, but now adjusted to conclude firmly in the tonic F minor rather than the dominant.
