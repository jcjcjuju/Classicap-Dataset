This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, comprises a single sentence structured as two phrases: the second phrase is an ornamented repetition of the first and is modified to conclude with a perfect cadence, whereas the fore-phrase ends with a half cadence. The transition begins with a distinctive five-note figure, which subsequently informs thematic material in the second subject and serves as the primary basis for the free fantasia. The second subject is presented in B flat major, the dominant key, and consists of two sentences. The first sentence’s fore-phrase subdivides into two two-bar sections, while its after-phrase—derived from the fore-phrase and initiating with a transient modulation to the tonic key—is not divisible into regular subsections. The second sentence is extended through cadential repetitions, and within it, a figure first heard in the seventeenth bar reappears in augmented form. The exposition concludes with a three-note link in E flat major that facilitates both the repeat of the exposition and the subsequent free fantasia.
