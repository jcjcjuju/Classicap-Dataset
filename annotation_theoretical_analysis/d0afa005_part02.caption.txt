This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of C minor, with its rhythmic structure concluding at the end of the eighth bar; the initial four bars are constructed over a tonic pedal point. This is followed by a connecting episode that commences with a restatement of the first subject, culminating on the dominant harmony. A subsequent passage in C minor, also terminating on the dominant, is then introduced and immediately repeated. The episode continues with three sequential modulatory passages derived from the first subject, successively transposed to the keys of G major, A-flat major, and B-flat major. These lead into a six-bar segment grounded on a pedal point, featuring an augmented reiteration of the first subject’s cadential material, which prepares the arrival of the second subject. The second subject begins not in the expected relative major (E-flat major) but rather in its parallel minor, E-flat minor, and is articulated in three distinct parts: the first part unfolds in E-flat minor, while the second and third parts shift to E-flat major. The exposition concludes with a coda that incorporates a fragment of the first subject transposed to E-flat major and terminates on the first inversion of the dominant seventh chord of G minor. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
