This constitutes the recapitulatory and concluding portion of a sonata-rondo form. It begins with a varied restatement of the first subject in the tonic key of G major; this third appearance of the theme incorporates a varied rendition of the internal repetition that had been omitted during its prior return. This is followed by an episode that corresponds to the earlier transitional episode but is significantly lengthened and concludes in D major rather than modulating to A major as in its initial occurrence. The second subject then appears transposed to the tonic key of G major, thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution typical of a recapitulation. A subsequent episode, derived from the earlier retransitional passage but now transposed to the tonic and extended, diverges from the structural norm by not leading to a literal return of the first subject; instead, it prepares a coda. The coda commences with a dominant pedal point over which contrapuntal allusions to the second section of the first subject are woven. In its final phase, the movement eschews a conventional restatement of the first subject in favor of multiple thematic reminiscences drawn from that material, which serve as a substitute for the expected concluding thematic return.
