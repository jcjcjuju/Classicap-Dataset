This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a fugue in D sharp minor. The exposition presents the subject in the alto in the tonic key of D sharp minor, followed by a real answer in the tenor in the dominant key of A sharp minor, accompanied by a countersubject in the alto. A codetta modulates from A sharp minor back to D sharp minor. The subject then reappears in the bass in the tonic, with the countersubject in the tenor, and is followed by an answer in the treble in A sharp minor with the countersubject in the bass. The modulatory section begins with Episode I, which modulates from A sharp minor through D sharp major to G sharp minor. This is succeeded by an altered answer in the bass in G sharp minor with a countersubject in the treble, followed by an altered subject in the alto in F sharp major without a countersubject, and another altered subject in the tenor in G sharp minor accompanied by a fragment of the countersubject in the bass. The original subject returns in the treble in D sharp minor with the countersubject in the tenor. A stretto commences with the first limb of the subject in the tenor in G sharp minor, followed by successive statements of the subject in the bass (D sharp minor), treble (C sharp minor), alto (F sharp major), and tenor (G sharp minor, altered). Episode II then modulates from D sharp minor through A sharp minor and returns to D sharp minor. The recapitulatory section features the subject in the bass in the tonic key, homophonically accompanied, followed by a codetta confirming D sharp minor. The subject then appears in the treble simultaneously with its answer in the tenor by inversion, both in D sharp minor, leading into a coda.
