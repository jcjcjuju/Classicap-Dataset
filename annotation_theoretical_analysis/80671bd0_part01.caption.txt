This constitutes the exposition, modulatory, and recapitulatory sections of a tonal fugue in F sharp minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the alto in the tonic key of F sharp minor, followed by a tonal answer in the treble in the dominant key of C sharp minor, without a counter-subject. A brief codetta modulates from C sharp minor back to F sharp minor, after which the subject reappears in the bass in the tonic. Episode I ensues, modulating from F sharp minor to C sharp minor, and is followed by an answer in the bass in C sharp minor and a subsequent statement of the subject in the treble in F sharp minor. The modulatory section commences with Episode II, which modulates to A major—closing there temporarily—before proceeding through a series of keys ultimately arriving at B minor; this episode introduces new imitative material and includes a reminiscence of the subject. A subject entry follows in the alto in B minor, succeeded by Episode III, which modulates from B minor to C sharp minor and combines material from both the subject and Episode II. An answer then appears in the bass in C sharp minor, leading into the extended Episode IV, which traverses a chromatic sequence of modulations—from C sharp minor through G sharp minor, E major, A major, and F sharp major—before settling in B minor; this episode is constructed on entirely new thematic material introduced by the alto and developed through imitation, inversion, and interwoven fragments of the original subject. Two further subject entries occur: first in the alto in B minor, then in the treble in F sharp minor. Episode V follows, modulating from F sharp minor to C sharp minor and featuring free imitation between treble and alto with running counterpoint in the bass. This is succeeded by an answer in the bass in C sharp minor and Episode VI, which modulates back to F sharp minor and incorporates reminiscences of the subject in the upper voices over a running bass line. The recapitulatory section presents the subject in the treble in the tonic key of F sharp minor, culminating in a coda that reaffirms the tonic.
