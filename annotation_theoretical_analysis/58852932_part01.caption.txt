This constitutes the exposition, counter-exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a real fugue in B major. The exposition presents the subject in the bass in the tonic key, followed by a codetta; a real answer appears in the tenor in the dominant key (F♯ major) accompanied by Counter-subject I in the bass, succeeded by a modulating codetta returning to B major. The subject recurs in the alto with Counter-subject I in the tenor, followed by another codetta; an answer then appears in the treble with Counter-subject I in the alto, again in F♯ major, and a codetta modulates back to B major. A redundant entry of the subject occurs in the bass with Counter-subject I in the treble, after which Episode I modulates from B major to F♯ major. The counter-exposition begins with an answer in the tenor in F♯ major, now accompanied by Counter-subject II in the treble; Episode II modulates back to B major, leading to a statement of the subject in the alto with a fragment of Counter-subject II in the tenor and its full statement in the bass. Episode III modulates again to F♯ major, followed by an answer in the treble with Counter-subject II in the alto. The modulatory section commences with a codetta shifting from D♯ minor to G♯ minor, where the subject appears in the bass with Counter-subject II in the treble; a codetta then modulates to C♯ minor for another subject statement in the tenor with Counter-subject II in the alto. Episode IV modulates from C♯ minor to E major, closing in that key; a further subject statement follows in the tenor with Counter-subject II in the treble in G♯ minor, succeeded by the extended Episode V, which modulates from G♯ minor back to B major. The recapitulatory section opens with the subject in the bass in B major, accompanied by fragmented material derived from Counter-subject II in the tenor—unusually aligned with the first bar of the subject rather than the second. Episode VI modulates from B major to D♯ minor, leading to an answer in the tenor in F♯ major with Counter-subject II in the alto; Episode VII then modulates back to B major, culminating in a final subject statement in the treble with Counter-subject II in the
