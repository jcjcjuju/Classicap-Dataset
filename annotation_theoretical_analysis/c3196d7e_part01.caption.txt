This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, exhibits an unusually extended length for Mozart, achieved through pervasive repetition and systematic inversion of voices. Its construction features a tonic pedal, transference of the melodic line to the bass with consequent part inversion upon the accompaniment’s reentry, and a tonal sequence that initiates a new phrase with re-inverted textures. An interrupted cadence prompts a cadential repetition of the preceding material, again beginning with inverted parts and culminating in an imitative passage derived from the opening motive. The transition is entirely based on this initial motive; although formally commencing after the first subject’s closure, it continues without break from the subject’s imitative tail, with the bass assuming the motivic figures. The remainder of the transition isolates a four-note fragment of the motive and concludes with a half cadence in C minor, articulated by a first-inversion chromatic supertonic ninth chord. The second subject unfolds in the dominant key (C major) and is divided into two sections. The first section elaborates its opening phrase through sequential treatment, including a responsive phrase in D minor that introduces a distinctive bass figure later developed throughout the movement. This section is then varied through textural inversion—melody in the bass answered by treble imitation at the octave—and further developed via contrary-motion responses to triplet figures, ultimately cadencing deceptively in G major. The second section begins with a new phrase in the bass, derived from the earlier bass figure, which concludes on a G pedal. Over this pedal, the phrase is transferred to the treble and significantly extended through imitative counterpoint between upper voices, featuring both free inversion and strict imitation at the fourth below, leading to a perfect cadence in D minor. A modulatory passage then returns to C major through a modified cadential repetition, prolonged by an interrupted cadence that initiates further extensions, including a chromatic supertonic harmony resolving via a German sixth chord to effect a smooth modulation back to the dominant key, where the second subject closes with a perfect cadence. The exposition concludes with a codetta whose triplet figuration is drawn from the first section of the second subject.
