This constitutes a literal restatement of the First Part in its entirety, thereby reaffirming the initial thematic and harmonic design. It opens with the first subject presented in A flat and D flat major, where the tonic key is approached via an initial statement in the dominant. The subject is subsequently repeated in a varied form, fulfilling the function of the conventional double bar and repeat. An episode follows, leading to a varied and extended return of the first subject in its original keys. The section concludes with a double bar and repeat instruction initiating from the episode’s outset, preserving the internal binary architecture of the original First Part.
