This constitutes the exposition’s first thematic group and subsequent interlude in a sonata-form movement. The first theme, in the tonic key of G minor, is introduced with a languidly rising arpeggiated motif decorated by an upper neighbour note (B♭ resolving to A). Tonal stability is initially affirmed through dominant seventh and tonic harmony, though the thematic material meanders through brief tonal suggestions of B♭ major (the relative major) and C minor (the subdominant), without effecting a full modulation. The phrase culminates in a V⁷–i cadence, preceded by a florid vocal-like fioritura. Harmonically, the passage is enriched by diatonic sevenths—including a ii half-diminished seventh—secondary dominant sevenths (notably the dominant seventh of V), diminished sevenths (such as E–G–B♭–D♭), and suspensions (e.g., E♭, A, and C♯ resolving to D, B♭, and D).  

This is followed by an interlude that grows increasingly animated. Its initial phrase features appoggiaturas in both hands, resolving expressively (e.g., F to E♭ and E♭ to D), and concludes with a V⁷–i cadence in G minor; this material is then restated with heightened intensity. The ensuing sempre più mosso section is underpinned by a quasi-pedal point on the tonic in the bass, with harmonic support drawn from tonic, dominant, and diminished seventh chords. Expressive dissonances arise through appoggiaturas and accented passing notes (e.g., F to E♭ and D to C). The interlude ultimately modulates toward B♭ major, facilitated by an augmented triad (G♭–B♭–D), and arrives at the dominant chord of B♭ major, whose root and fifth (F–C) are reiterated to prepare the subsequent thematic entry.
