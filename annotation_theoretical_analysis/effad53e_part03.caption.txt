This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of B flat major, preserving its original thematic material. It is followed by a modified connecting episode, which diverges from its exposition counterpart by concluding in the dominant key rather than in C major, thereby maintaining tonal coherence within the recapitulatory framework. The second subject then appears transposed to the tonic key of B flat major, fulfilling the structural expectation of thematic resolution in sonata form. The movement concludes with a coda that closely replicates the material of the exposition’s coda, now transposed into the tonic key.
