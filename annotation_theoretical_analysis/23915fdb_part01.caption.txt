This constitutes the exposition of a binary-form prelude. The first period presents a self-contained thematic statement that culminates in a perfect cadence in the dominant key, F major. The second period initiates a modulatory process, introducing a contrasting motivic figure that alters the character and texture of the music. This section ultimately resolves into a coda that reaffirms the tonic key, providing structural closure to the movement.
