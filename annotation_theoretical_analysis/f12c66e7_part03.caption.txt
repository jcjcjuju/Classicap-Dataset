This constitutes the final thematic return and coda of a rondo-like structure. The first subject reappears in the tonic key of A flat major, presenting its original thematic material. At its midpoint, the subject is transposed up an octave, mirroring the registral treatment heard at the movement’s opening. Following this restatement, the music transitions into a coda, which serves to conclude the movement without further thematic development or modulation.
