This constitutes the exposition, modulatory, and recapitulatory sections of a tonal fugue in B flat major, followed by a coda. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the treble in the tonic key of B flat major, succeeded by a tonal answer in the alto in the dominant key of F major, accompanied by the first counter-subject in the treble. The subject then appears in the bass in B flat major, with counter-subject I in the alto and counter-subject II simultaneously introduced in the treble. A further statement of the answer occurs in the treble in F major, now accompanied by counter-subject I in the bass and counter-subject II in the alto, completing the exposition with triple counterpoint fully established.

The modulatory section commences with Episode I, which modulates from F major to G minor through sequential and imitative material derived from the subject. This is followed by a statement of the subject in the alto in G minor, with counter-subject I in the treble and counter-subject II in the bass. An answer then appears in the bass in C minor, accompanied by counter-subject I in the alto and counter-subject II in the treble. Episode II ensues, modulating from C minor through G major and returning to C minor, and is structured as an inversion of Episode I with the addition of an independent alto line. Subsequently, an answer is presented in the alto in E flat major, with counter-subject I in the treble and counter-subject II in the bass, immediately followed by the subject in the treble in E flat major, accompanied by counter-subject I in the alto and counter-subject II in the bass.

The recapitulatory section features the answer in the alto in the tonic key of B flat major, with counter-subject I in the treble and counter-subject II in the bass. The movement concludes with a coda in E flat major.
