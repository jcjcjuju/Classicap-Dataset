This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is constructed from motivic material derived from both the first and second subjects as well as the codetta. It opens in C minor with the opening motive of the first subject combined contrapuntally with triplet figures originating from both the codetta and the first section of the second subject. This initial sentence concludes in G minor and is immediately followed by an inverted, overlapping repetition that modulates to end on a half-cadence in D minor. In D minor, a new passage begins, based on the opening motive of the second subject; this is accompanied by imitative treatment of a characteristic bass figure that, in the exposition, first appears in the second phrase of the second subject. This figure is deployed above and below the main motive, with the voices alternately inverted and re-inverted at each successive repetition. These repetitions occur sequentially in the keys of D minor, G minor, C major, and F major, thereby forming a modulating sequence. Subsequently, the motive is presented in both parts simultaneously, with the bass imitating the treble at a half-bar’s distance—first at the interval of a fifth below in B flat major, then transposed to F major at the octave. In the following stage, the motive appears in both voices in contrary motion. The development concludes with a restatement of the closing material of the codetta, now set over the dominant seventh chord of F major.
