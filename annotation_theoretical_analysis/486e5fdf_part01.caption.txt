This constitutes the theme (or “Air”) of a variation movement in A-flat major. The structure begins with two balanced eight-bar phrases, each concluding with a full cadence in the tonic key, thereby establishing a stable thematic foundation. Following this binary presentation, the music shifts to B-flat minor for a two-bar passage, which is then treated sequentially over the next two bars. This sequential treatment initiates a modulatory process that unfolds over six bars, culminating in a clear establishment of the dominant key. The section concludes with a restatement of the second eight-bar phrase of the Air, reaffirming the thematic material in its original form and tonal context.
