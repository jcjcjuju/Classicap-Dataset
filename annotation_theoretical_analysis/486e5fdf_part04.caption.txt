This constitutes the third variation of a theme-and-variations movement. The variation is set entirely in A flat minor and spans the full thirty-five-bar span of the original theme. Syncopation is employed throughout the variation, consistently displacing rhythmic accents to create metric tension against the underlying pulse. The harmonic framework adheres to the structural outline of the original “Air,” preserving its bipartite phrase organization and cadential articulation, though now inflected through the parallel minor mode. The pervasive syncopated rhythm permeates all voices, reinterpreting the thematic material through rhythmic displacement while maintaining the original formal proportions and tonal trajectory.
