This constitutes the exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in F minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the treble in the tonic key of F minor, followed by a tonal answer in the alto in the dominant key of C minor, without a countersubject. A codetta then modulates from C minor back to F minor, after which the subject reappears in the bass in the tonic. The modulatory section comprises four episodes interspersed with subject entries. Episode I modulates from F minor to A♭ major, leading to a subject statement in the treble in A♭ major, which is answered in the alto in E♭ major. Episode II modulates from E♭ major through C major to F minor, followed by a subject entry in the bass in F minor. Episode III modulates from F minor through B♭ minor back to F minor, preceding a subject statement in the alto in F minor. Episode IV then modulates from F minor to B♭ minor, culminating in a subject entry in the treble in B♭ minor. The recapitulatory section presents the subject in the alto in F minor, immediately followed by a coda firmly rooted in the tonic key of F minor.
