This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. It commences in B flat major and is predominantly constructed upon the rhythmic motive derived from the initial five bars of the first subject, with the opening phrase of the development closely mirroring this rhythmic profile. The thematic material is treated developmentally, maintaining a clear referential relationship to the exposition’s primary theme while undergoing harmonic and textural transformation. The section culminates on a dominant seventh harmony, preparing the return of the tonic key in the subsequent recapitulation.
