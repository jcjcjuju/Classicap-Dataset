This constitutes the recapitulatory and concluding section of a sonata-form movement, beginning with a return of the first subject in the tonic key of C minor, presented without the continuation phrase that followed its initial appearance. A brief episode follows, constructed from motives derived from the sixth and seventh bars of the first subject; this episode takes sequential form, with a two-bar unit in C minor immediately repeated, and then effects a modulation to C major via an augmented sixth chord, preparing the tonal context for the second subject. The second subject now appears in the tonic major (C major), affirming a Picardy-third-inflected resolution of the movement’s tonal polarity. A connecting passage, analogous to the transition heard earlier but now altered and extended, leads to a final statement of the first subject in the tonic minor, this time incorporating a varied and abbreviated version of its original continuation. The movement concludes with a coda that opens with material derived from the second subject, subjected to variation and expansion. This gives way to a passage in C minor that modulates—through the Neapolitan sixth chord—to the dominant seventh of A♭ major, where a final allusion to the first subject occurs; this reference is then followed by a retransition to the tonic key, mediated by an augmented sixth chord, before the movement ends with a descending scalar passage in the C harmonic minor scale.
