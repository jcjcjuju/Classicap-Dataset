This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a fugue in F sharp major. The exposition begins with the subject stated in the alto in the tonic key, followed by a real answer in the treble in the dominant key of C sharp major, accompanied by the counter-subject in the alto. The subject then appears in the bass in the tonic, with the counter-subject in the treble. This is succeeded by Episode I, which modulates from F sharp major through D sharp minor and G sharp minor before returning to F sharp major. A subsequent entry of the subject occurs in the treble in the tonic, with the counter-subject now in the bass, followed by Episode II, which modulates from F sharp major to C sharp major. The exposition concludes with a real answer in the bass in C sharp major, accompanied by the counter-subject in the alto, and a final statement of the subject in the alto in the tonic, with the counter-subject in the bass.

The modulatory section commences with the subject in the treble in D sharp minor, accompanied by the counter-subject in the alto. Episode III follows, modulating from D sharp minor to B major, after which the subject appears in the alto in B major with the counter-subject in the treble. Episode IV then modulates from B major back to F sharp major.

The recapitulatory section opens with the subject in the bass in F sharp major, accompanied by the counter-subject in the treble. A codetta modulates to C sharp major, leading to an answer in the alto in that key, where the counter-subject is notably absent. Another codetta modulates back to F sharp major, preceding a final statement of the subject in the treble, accompanied by a slightly altered version of the counter-subject in the alto. The movement concludes with a coda firmly in F sharp major.
