This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is principally derived from previously presented thematic material. At its midpoint, a new subject emerges, which unfolds over a sustained harmonic trajectory before yielding to a renewed reference to the first subject. The development culminates in a six-bar dominant pedal point, reinforcing harmonic tension in preparation for the subsequent recapitulation.
