This constitutes a literal recapitulation of the first part in the tonic key of F minor, followed by a coda. The recapitulated material reproduces the structural and harmonic trajectory of the initial section: it opens with a two-phrase first subject, each phrase four bars in length, both cadencing on the dominant major harmony. A developmental passage ensues, commencing with an eight-bar sequential treatment derived from the inversion of the rhythmic motive presented in the fifth and sixth bars of the opening theme, culminating in a cadence in A-flat major (the relative major). A new thematic figure, motivically linked to the third and fourth bars of the first subject, appears in the relative major before the music returns to the tonic key through a reprise of the opening material—now adjusted to conclude firmly in F minor rather than on the dominant. The coda that follows consists solely of a series of chords in the tonic key of F minor, ultimately resolving on a Picardy third with a major tonic chord.
