This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. It opens with the principal subject, an eight-bar sentence of highly regular construction comprising two four-bar phrases; the second phrase is a variation of the first, altered to conclude with a full cadence rather than a half cadence. This thematic material is followed by Episode I, an eight-bar sentence in the dominant key (G major), which is derived from the principal subject—its second phrase beginning with the opening motive of the subject transposed into the dominant. A brief four-bar link ensues, commencing on the G major chord and, by its midpoint, introducing the dominant seventh chord of G major, thereby preparing the return of the principal subject. The principal subject then reappears in its original form, presenting the same eight-bar sentence with its characteristic regular phrase structure and cadential design. Throughout this section, the rhythmic organization remains consistently based on four-bar units, reinforcing the structural clarity of the exposition.
