This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. It commences with the first subject theme presented in F sharp minor—the relative minor of the tonic A major—initially supported by a dominant pedal. The remainder of the section is predominantly derived from the first seven notes of the first subject, undergoing a series of modulations: it progresses from F sharp minor to A major, then to C sharp minor, followed by B minor, and ultimately returns to A major following a sequential passage. Throughout, the thematic material is reworked contrapuntally and harmonically, exploring a range of closely related keys while maintaining motivic coherence through fragmentation and sequential treatment.
