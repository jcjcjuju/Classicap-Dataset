This constitutes the recapitulatory section of a sonata-rondo form, beginning with a varied restatement of the first subject in the tonic key of A major. This is followed by a modified and abbreviated version of the original episode, which now remains within the tonic orbit. The second subject then reappears transposed from its original dominant key (E major) into the tonic key of A major, with slight alterations to its thematic material, and concludes with a full cadence in the tonic. A further varied return of the first subject ensues, significantly elaborated, featuring a brief modulation to F major initiated by a pivot at the midpoint; this digression is resolved through an enharmonic reinterpretation that facilitates a return to the tonic key. The section culminates in a coda comprising modulatory allusions to both the first and third subjects, thereby synthesizing thematic material from earlier sections while reinforcing the tonal stability of the tonic.
