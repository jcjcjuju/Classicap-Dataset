This constitutes the exposition, modulatory, and recapitulatory sections of a fugue in C major, featuring a real answer and no counter-subject. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the alto in the tonic key of C major, followed by a real answer in the treble and then in the tenor, both in the dominant key of G major. The subject returns in the bass in C major, after which the treble reiterates the subject in C major while the tenor simultaneously presents the answer in G major in stretto. This is followed by an answer in the alto in G major and a subject entry in the bass, now transposed to G major, initiating the modulatory section. In this section, the alto presents the answer in stretto with the preceding bass entry, still in G major, before the tenor states the subject and effects a full close in A minor. The subject then resumes immediately in C major in the alto, with an incomplete answer in the tenor in stretto; this is followed by answers in the bass and treble in G major, concluding the first complete stretto. A second complete stretto ensues, initiated by the subject in the treble in C major, answered by the alto in C major and the tenor in D minor, with the bass concluding the stretto on the subject in D minor. The third complete stretto begins with the subject in the tenor in D major, immediately followed by the subject in the alto in G major in stretto, an incomplete subject in the bass in G major, and finally an answer in the treble in G major. The recapitulatory section opens with an answer in the tenor leading to a close in C major. The subject then appears in the tenor over a sustained tonic pedal on C, which persists to the end of the fugue. This is accompanied by an answer in the alto in F major in stretto and an incomplete answer in the treble also in F major. The movement concludes with a coda in C major, constructed primarily from the semiquaver figure that terminates the subject and a motive derived from the ascending opening gesture of the subject.
