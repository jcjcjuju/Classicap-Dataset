This constitutes the recapitulatory section of a sonata-form movement, followed by a coda. The first subject returns in the tonic key of E flat major, and within this statement, a previously presented segment of the first subject reappears in inversion. An episode follows, initiating with an exact imitation of the opening four bars of the first episode from the exposition; this material subsequently modulates and concludes on a dominant harmony. The second subject then ensues, now transposed to the tonic key of E flat major, thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of a recapitulation. A further episode, analogous to the second episode of the exposition, begins in A flat major and terminates on a dominant seventh chord. The movement concludes with a coda that incorporates thematic material from the introduction of the third movement, transposed into E flat major; following a cadenza, the final Presto section is constructed from the second and third notes of the first subject.
