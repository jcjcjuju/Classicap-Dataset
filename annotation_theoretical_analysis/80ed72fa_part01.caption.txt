This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key of F minor, opens with a four-bar phrase that cadences on the dominant; this phrase is immediately repeated transposed up by a semitone, effecting a modulation to D♭ major via a Neapolitan sixth chord, which also functions as the subdominant of D♭ major. Subsequent material includes a recurrence of the opening two-bar idea in the original tonic key, followed by its restatement in F minor. At this point, a distinctive motivic figure appears that bears a clear resemblance to the principal theme of the first movement of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 in C minor. The first subject concludes with a half-cadence on the dominant of F minor. Within this section, an A♮ is enharmonically reinterpreted as B♭♭, functioning as the minor ninth above A♭. The connecting episode begins by developing material from the first subject before introducing, at its midpoint, a new triplet-based figure that creates an inverted pedal point on the dominant of the relative major (A♭ major), ultimately arriving at a cadence in that key. In this episode, an E♮ is more accurately notated as F♭, serving as the minor ninth of the dominant of A♭ major. The second subject commences in A♭ major and is divided into two contrasting parts: the first part (in A♭ major) echoes the opening gesture of the first subject, while the transition in its final bars modulates to A♭ minor, in which key the second part unfolds with marked textural and affective contrast. The exposition closes with a brief coda.
