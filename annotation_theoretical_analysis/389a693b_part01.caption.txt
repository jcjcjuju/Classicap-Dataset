This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of G major and features a series of modulations: it moves to D major, then to F major, and subsequently to C major, before concluding with a full cadential closure in the tonic G major. The connecting episode begins with a restatement of the final cadence of the first subject and continues with material derived from the opening of the first subject, ultimately arriving at a dominant harmony that functions as the dominant of B major, accompanied by a thematic reminiscence of the first subject. The second subject departs from the conventional dominant key and instead unfolds in B major, followed by a partial repetition of its opening passage transposed to the bass and rendered in B minor; this is succeeded by an extended sequential passage that modulates through multiple keys. The exposition concludes with a coda that introduces a two-bar figure in B minor, which is then restated in B major and again in B minor, with the final iteration of the figure remaining in B minor and undergoing rhythmic diminution to a single bar.
