This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The material is derived from two primary sources: the codetta and the transition of the exposition. The section commences with the codetta figures transposed from G major to G minor, initiating a process of motivic development. These codetta-derived figures alternate with scalar passages—both ascending and descending—that are based on material introduced in the transition. The harmonic trajectory modulates successively through D minor, A minor, C major, and returns to A minor, ultimately arriving at a dominant seventh chord in F major. This terminal harmony establishes F major—the subdominant of the original tonic—as the unexpected tonal center for the subsequent recapitulation.
