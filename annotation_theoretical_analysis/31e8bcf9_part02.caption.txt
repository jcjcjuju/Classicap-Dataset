This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of E flat major and is structured in three overlapping sections, each beginning and ending in the tonic. The initial section features the thematic material in the treble, followed by a second section in which the subject appears in the bass accompanied by a new figuration in the treble; the third section retains the subject in the bass but introduces a different accompanying texture in the treble. A connecting episode follows, commencing with florid passagework over a tonic pedal point, which subsequently modulates to the dominant key. This episode includes a four-bar phrase in G flat major, immediately restated in F major, with the entire passage then repeated with added embellishments and variations. The harmonic basis of the G flat major passages is identified as the Neapolitan sixth chord in relation to F major, the dominant key of the upcoming second subject. The second subject is then presented in B flat major and organized into consistent four-bar phrases. The first phrase is restated an octave higher, while the second phrase undergoes variation and inversion upon its repetition. Further short phrases are repeated an octave lower, with slight alterations in the final repetition. The exposition concludes with a brief coda-like passage of four bars over dominant harmony in the key of the dominant.
