This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. It opens with the principal subject in the tonic key, structured as a sixteen-bar sentence organized in four-bar phrases, extended to twenty bars through cadential repetition. The second phrase concludes with a half-cadence, while the fourth phrase initially closes with an interrupted cadence, subsequently repeated to achieve a full cadence. A lengthy modulating passage follows, beginning in the relative major (C major) and incorporating a varied statement of the principal subject in both C minor and C major; this section is significantly expanded and features frequent tonal allusions to D minor, ultimately modulating to E minor, where it concludes on a half-cadence. The sequential nature of this passage is emphasized, particularly in a real sequence between D minor and E minor. The second subject appears in E minor—the dominant minor—unusually departing from the conventional relative major for minor-mode sonata forms. Moreover, it introduces no new thematic material, instead presenting an inversion of the principal subject and developing entirely from previously heard content transposed into the dominant minor. A connecting episode ensues, characterized by sequential motion in the bass and inner voices during its initial segment and culminating in a half-cadence; this passage also contains a Neapolitan sixth chord. The exposition concludes exceptionally: rather than terminating after the second entry of the principal subject in the tonic, it proceeds without pause into a modified transposition of part of the preceding episode, now in the tonic key—an unprecedented feature in Mozart’s piano sonatas.
