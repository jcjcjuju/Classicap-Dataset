This constitutes an episode that functions as a developmental and modulatory intermediary within the movement’s overall structure. It commences in A flat minor and features two distinct enharmonic modulations. The first occurs at the onset of a thematic statement in E major, where the opening phrase of the first subject—originally presented in A flat major—is transposed and restated in this distantly related key. The second enharmonic modulation arises from E major and leads to the dominant minor ninth chord of E flat major. This sonority resolves into a succession of dominant-function harmonies in E flat, specifically chords of the eleventh and dominant seventh, which prepare the return of the first subject in the tonic key. Throughout this episode, the accompaniment adopts a triplet-based rhythmic figuration in the harmonic rhythm, a textural transformation that persists for the remainder of the movement.
