This constitutes an episode in C major. It comprises two distinct four-bar sections, each of which is repeated. The first section presents its material in the key of C major, while the second section initially remains within that key before effecting a modulation to G major at its close. Following this modulation, the second section is extended beyond its original phrase structure, functioning as a connecting passage that leads to the subsequent reappearance of the first subject in the tonic key.
