This constitutes the first part of a binary form, comprising two distinct sentences. The initial eight-bar sentence is rooted in F major (tonic) and modulates to C major (dominant), prominently featuring an opening motivic figure consisting of four repeated C’s, which undergoes imitation and repetition throughout this section. This sentence is followed by a twelve-bar sentence that begins in G minor and ultimately modulates back to F major. Within this second sentence, an early modulation to G minor is succeeded by a further modulation to B♭ major, reflecting a characteristic tendency in this form to explore keys on the subdominant side during the course of the section. Notably, the cadential gestures concluding each of the two sentences—specifically the terminations of the first and second sentences—exhibit a marked similarity, a structural feature commonly found in binary form. The entire Part I is designated for repetition.
