This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata-form movement. The first subject returns in the tonic key of A flat major, followed by the connecting episode that reestablishes the original tonal framework without modulation. This sequence is then repeated in its entirety, though the first subject is now presented in a varied form. The second subject reappears not in the tonic, as conventional sonata form would dictate, but begins in G flat major—an irregular choice that deviates from standard practice—before ultimately resolving into the tonic key. The movement concludes with an elongated coda, which extends the formal closure beyond the typical scope.
