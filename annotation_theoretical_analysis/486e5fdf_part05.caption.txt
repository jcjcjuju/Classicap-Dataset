This constitutes the fourth variation of a theme-and-variations movement. The variation is set in A-flat major and spans the full thematic span of the original Air. Syncopation is freely employed throughout, with the principal metrical accent consistently displaced to the third beat of each bar, thereby creating a sustained rhythmic tension against the underlying duple meter. The harmonic and structural framework adheres to that of the theme, preserving its phraseology and tonal trajectory, while the rhythmic reorganization imparts a distinctive character to the variation without altering its formal outline.
