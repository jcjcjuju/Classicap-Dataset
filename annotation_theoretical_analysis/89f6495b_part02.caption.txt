This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, in the tonic key of E flat major, commences on the subdominant chord and is structured in two sections. It is derived from the “Le-be-wohl” motif introduced in the movement’s introduction, with Bars 1–2 presenting a sequential treatment of this phrase; a variant of the motif, drawn from the introduction’s Bars 2–3, appears in the bass with a dotted first note in Bars 3–4. The connecting episode begins with a literal restatement of the second section of the first subject, followed by passages in contrary motion. Within this episode, the “Le-be-wohl” phrase recurs in Bars 19–22 simultaneously in the bass and in inversion in the treble, replicating the bass form from Bars 3–4; it reappears in the treble in Bars 30–32 with the initial note prolonged. The episode concludes with a full cadence in the dominant key, B flat major. The second subject, presented in B flat major, features an augmented (quadrupled) statement of the “Le-be-wohl” phrase; Bars 34–37 are immediately repeated an octave lower in Bars 38–41. A coda follows, whose initial two bars are restated an octave higher; Bars 46–49 employ the “Le-be-wohl” phrase subjected to varied contrapuntal and rhythmic treatments, including diminution in the treble. The exposition concludes with a transitional passage that evokes the “Le-be-wohl” phrase, ultimately preparing both the repeat of the exposition and the subsequent development section.
