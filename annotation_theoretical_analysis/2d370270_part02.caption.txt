This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with a fragment of the first subject transposed to C major. Subsequently, the second subject is treated developmentally: it appears for eight bars in F minor, followed immediately by a sequential repetition in B♭ minor; across these sixteen bars, harmonic activity is restricted exclusively to tonic and dominant harmonies of the respective keys. The remainder of the development draws material from the connecting episode of the exposition, reworking it into a modulatory passage that prepares the return of the first subject.
