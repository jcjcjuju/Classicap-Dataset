This constitutes the exposition of the first subject in a movement that functions as an introduction to the subsequent fourth movement. The section presents a thematic statement in A flat major, the tonic key, and spans a self-contained phrase that concludes with a half cadence on the dominant harmony. The harmonic trajectory establishes the tonal center through conventional phrase structure, culminating in an imperfect authentic cadence that creates forward momentum by withholding full resolution to the tonic.
