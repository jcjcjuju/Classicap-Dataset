This constitutes the introduction and primary thematic exposition of a movement in A flat minor. The introduction begins in B flat minor and, over the course of three bars, modulates to a cadenza in A flat minor; this is followed by an enharmonic reinterpretation leading to a cadenza in E major, which then modulates back to A flat minor—the tonic key of the ensuing movement. The main body of the movement opens with a reiteration of the tonic chord and unfolds as a continuous melody structured into four sequential four-bar phrases. The first phrase establishes the tonic key and concludes with a half-close on the dominant. The second phrase begins again in the tonic but modulates to conclude in the relative major, C flat major. The third phrase originates in C flat major and effects a half-close on the dominant of A flat minor. The fourth phrase remains entirely within A flat minor, both beginning and ending in the tonic, and is subsequently followed by a two-bar coda. Throughout, the movement employs a key signature of six flats despite the theoretical requirement of seven for A flat minor.
