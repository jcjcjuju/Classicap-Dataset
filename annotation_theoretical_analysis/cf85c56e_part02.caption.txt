This constitutes an episode in B♭ major. The section commences with a two-bar introduction that evokes the opening gesture of the first subject, establishing a motivic link while initiating the new tonal area. This is followed by a distinct phrase that undergoes sequential treatment, first appearing in G minor and then transposed to E♭ major. A subsequent passage in E♭ major concludes with a dominant seventh chord of F major, initiating a series of episodic modulations derived from the first subject’s material. These modulatory gestures ultimately resolve onto a dominant seventh harmony, which functions as a structural dominant preparation at the close of the section.
