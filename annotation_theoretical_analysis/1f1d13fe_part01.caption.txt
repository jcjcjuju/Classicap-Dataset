This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a real fugue in C sharp minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the bass in the tonic key of C sharp minor, followed immediately by a real answer in the treble in the dominant key of G sharp minor, with no counter-subject. A codetta modulates from G sharp minor back to C sharp minor, after which the subject reappears in the alto in the tonic. This is succeeded by Episode I, which modulates through E major before returning to C sharp minor. The exposition concludes with a statement of the subject in the treble in C sharp minor and a subsequent real answer in the alto in G sharp minor.

The modulatory section commences with the subject in the bass transposed to E major, followed by a codetta that modulates to B major. The subject then appears in the treble by inversion in B major, answered in the alto by inversion in C sharp minor. Another inverted statement of the subject follows in the bass in C sharp minor, succeeded by a codetta modulating to F sharp major. The subject returns in its original form in the alto in C sharp minor, leading into Episode II, which undertakes an extended modulation through G sharp minor, F sharp minor, B major, F sharp minor, and ultimately back to C sharp minor. A further statement of the subject occurs in the treble in C sharp minor, followed by Episode III, which modulates from C sharp minor to A major. In this key, the subject appears in the alto by inversion—slightly altered in its intervallic skips—and simultaneously in the bass in its original form in C sharp minor. Episode IV follows, briefly touching upon G sharp minor before returning to C sharp minor, and is succeeded by an answer in the alto. Episode V then modulates from C sharp minor to E major and back again to C sharp minor.

The recapitulatory section opens with the subject in the alto in C sharp minor, followed by a real answer in the bass in G sharp major, slightly altered in several places. The movement concludes with a coda. Throughout, the fugue employs free inversion of the subject and answer, beginning in the modulatory section, and features five episodes and three codettas that together constitute more than half of the movement’s duration.
