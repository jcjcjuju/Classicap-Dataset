This constitutes the Trio section in an extended ternary (ABABA) form, set in B major—the tonic major—and characterized by a lyrical, lullaby-like quality derived from a Polish Christmas carol. The initial A section establishes B major with predominantly diatonic writing, briefly modulating to F sharp major before returning to a perfect cadence in B major, where the dominant chord features an added sixth (D sharp). The subsequent B section initiates a sequential passage that modulates from B major to G sharp minor, articulated by a diminished seventh chord and culminating in an imperfect cadence; it then alternates between dominant seventh and supertonic seventh chords of G sharp minor before reestablishing B major. The following A section replicates the opening thematic material without alteration. The second B section mirrors its predecessor with only minor ornamental modifications. The final A section initially restates the original theme but diverges in its closing phrase: a dominant pedal underpins Bars 377–380, within which a diminished seventh chord appears, and a German augmented sixth chord (D–F sharp–A–B sharp) resolves deceptively to F sharp minor. The section concludes with a brief interlude that juxtaposes the movement’s opening fortissimo chords against fading echoes of the Trio theme played pianissimo and smorzando.
