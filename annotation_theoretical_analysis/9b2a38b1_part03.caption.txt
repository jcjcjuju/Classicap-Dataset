This constitutes a literal return of the Scherzo section, presenting the complete Simple Binary form initially heard at the outset of the movement. It opens with the first subject in A major, articulated in two four-bar phrases: the first phrase cadences on the dominant harmony, while the second confirms the tonic key. This is followed by a developmental section that modulates through G sharp minor and employs a sequential passage of dominant seventh chords to reestablish the tonic. The first subject then reappears in its entirety in A major, and the section concludes with a brief coda derived motivically from the opening thematic material.
