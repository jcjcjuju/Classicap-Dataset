This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of D minor, now expanded: the initial Largo gesture—originally two bars—is extended to six bars before proceeding with the remainder of the subject as presented in the exposition. The subsequent connecting episode begins identically to its expositional counterpart for two bars but then diverges significantly in character. It features a four-bar recitative, followed by a four-bar passage in F sharp minor, which is reached through an enharmonic modulation; this passage is immediately repeated in G minor and then imitated over the next five bars, culminating on a dominant harmony. The second subject follows, now transposed to the tonic key of D minor rather than appearing in the dominant minor as in the exposition; a specific passage within this section reflects accommodation to the limited compass of the instrument available during Beethoven’s time, precluding a literal transposition of the corresponding expositional material. The movement concludes with an extended coda, the final twelve bars of which consist exclusively of tonic harmony. Notably, the relative major key is entirely absent throughout the entire movement.
