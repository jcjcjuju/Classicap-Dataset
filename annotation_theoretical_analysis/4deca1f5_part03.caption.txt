This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in its original form and in the tonic key of E flat major. Following this, the connecting episode reappears, largely preserving its earlier material but now transposed predominantly into G flat major. The second subject then enters in G flat major, subsequently shifting to the tonic minor (E flat minor) and modulating by its conclusion to the dominant key. The movement concludes with a coda that begins as an extended elaboration of the dominant seventh chord; in its final portion, the coda incorporates repeated thematic allusions to the first subject.
