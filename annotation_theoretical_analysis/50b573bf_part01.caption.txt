This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The principal subject is a sixteen-bar sentence in A major, comprising an eight-bar theme that concludes initially with a half-cadence; this theme is then restated in varied form and concludes with a full cadence. The second subject begins with a new thematic idea in the tonic key of A major and modulates to E major (the dominant), where it achieves a full cadence; this sentence is subsequently extended through cadential repetitions. Following this, the principal subject returns in a varied second entry, maintaining its thematic identity while undergoing modification in its presentation.
