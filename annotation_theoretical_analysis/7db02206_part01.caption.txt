This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of C minor and is entirely derived from its initial six-note motive. A connecting episode follows, beginning with a reference to the first subject over a tonic pedal point for four bars; this episode proceeds through florid passagework and concludes with a dominant chord in G major—an atypical dominant preparation for the ensuing key of E-flat major. The second subject then appears in E-flat major, the relative major, and concludes its thematic statement before bar 25, after which a brief developmental treatment of its final two bars ensues. The exposition closes with a coda that opens with a variation of the first subject transposed into the relative major: initially stated in the bass and then imitated in the treble. This is followed by a three-bar passage that is immediately repeated with slight variation; a similar treatment occurs later in the coda, where another three-bar unit undergoes immediate repetition with modification. The coda ultimately concludes on a sustained pedal point in E-flat major.
