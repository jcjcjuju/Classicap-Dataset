This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in E flat major. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the treble, whose second limb is distinctly in B flat, followed immediately by a tonal answer in the alto accompanied by a countersubject in the treble; this answer effects an alternation from the first to the second note to preserve tonal stability. A brief codetta derived from the tail of the subject appears in the treble and becomes a generative motive throughout the fugue. The subject then reappears in the bass with a countersubject in the alto, reaffirming the tonic–dominant polarity of E flat and B flat. Episode I follows, modulating from B flat back to E flat and constructed primarily from the codetta figure. A further statement of the answer enters in the treble with a countersubject in the bass, solidifying the tonic key.

The modulatory section commences with Episode II, which sequences from E flat major to C minor, leading to a cadential close in C minor where the answer appears in the alto with a countersubject in the treble. A short codetta ensues, followed by the subject in the bass accompanied by a countersubject in the alto, now unfolding over a harmonic trajectory from C minor to G minor. Episode III then modulates from G minor back to E flat major, after which the answer is stated in the bass with a treble countersubject in the tonic. Episode IV traverses a modulation from E flat through B flat and returns to E flat, preceding a statement of the subject in the treble with an alto countersubject that again reflects the E flat–B flat tonal axis. Episode V continues this developmental process, modulating from E flat through A flat and B flat before resolving back to E flat, featuring melodic strides of a ninth in the treble and free imitation in contrary motion by the alto of the treble’s arpeggiated figure.

The recapitulatory section initiates with an answer in the alto in the tonic key of E flat, notably without a countersubject, followed by a coda that remains in E flat and includes a momentary bass imitation of the treble’s descending figure.
