This constitutes an introductory Adagio section functioning as a prelude to the finale. It is characterized by a fragmentary structure and opens with dominant harmony, establishing a sense of tonal anticipation rather than immediate resolution. The texture and thematic material are largely derived from a recurring motivic figure first presented in the treble voice, which serves as the primary generative cell for much of the passage. The section culminates in a cadenza articulated over a dominant chord, reinforcing the harmonic instability and delaying arrival on the tonic, thereby heightening the expectation for the subsequent movement.
