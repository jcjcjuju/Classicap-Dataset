This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first thematic period establishes the tonic key of C sharp minor, presenting Theme I which modulates to its dominant major (G sharp) before returning to the tonic. This theme then undergoes varied treatment, culminating in a perfect cadence in the dominant minor (G sharp minor). The second period begins in G sharp minor and modulates through C sharp major and B major, ultimately arriving at a perfect cadence in the relative major, E major. The third period introduces new material characterized by imitative counterpoint, progressing through the subdominant minor (F sharp minor) and B minor, and concluding with a perfect cadence in F sharp minor. The fourth period returns to the tonic minor, C sharp minor, and closes with a perfect cadence in that key. The fifth and final period of the exposition restates Theme I in the treble in the original tonic key, now surrounded by more florid and vivacious figuration; it features a descending sequential passage in the bass derived from earlier motivic material, accompanied by florid counterpoint in the upper voices, and includes a statement of Theme II—prefaced by three sixteenth notes—answered canonically by the alto and followed by a free version in the bass, ultimately concluding with a perfect cadence in the tonic minor.
