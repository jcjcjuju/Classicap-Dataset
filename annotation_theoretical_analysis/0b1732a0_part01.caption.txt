This constitutes the exposition of a binary form, comprising two distinct periods that outline a tonal trajectory from tonic to dominant and back to tonic. Period I establishes the tonic key through a tonic pedal in its opening, subsequently modulating to the subdominant minor (B♭ minor) and then to the relative major, ultimately concluding with a perfect cadence in the dominant. Period II begins with a thematic return suggestive of the opening material, followed by a dominant pedal that spans several bars, culminating in a final cadence in the tonic key featuring a major third. The harmonic design of the entire passage reflects a balanced tonal plan, with the first period emphasizing tonal departure and the second effecting a structural return, while melodic content is consistently supported by ornamental figuration derived from arpeggios, passing tones, and auxiliary notes.
