This constitutes the exposition of a binary-form prelude, comprising two distinct periods that articulate a tonal trajectory from tonic to dominant and back. Period I establishes the tonic key through a tonic pedal in its opening, subsequently modulating through D major, A minor, and E minor before concluding with a perfect cadence in the dominant key, D major. Period II initiates with a dominant pedal, briefly alluding to C major and D major in its initial gestures, and ultimately reaffirms the tonic key with structural finality. The entire passage is characterized by motivic figures featuring octave skips in the bass, which contribute to the movement’s rhythmic vitality and textural clarity.
