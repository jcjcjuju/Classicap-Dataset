This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The section is founded primarily on a motivic figure introduced in the opening bars, which is subsequently treated through contrary motion and serves as the principal generative material. Two distinct thematic ideas emerge: Theme II, a clearly articulated second subject in the complementary key, and Theme III, which further contributes to the structural and textural fabric of the section. The harmonic trajectory culminates in a perfect cadence in the dominant key, thereby confirming the tonal polarity characteristic of sonata exposition. The texture throughout is predominantly three-voiced, though occasional reductions to two parts occur, and the thematic material is developed through sequential and imitative techniques that anticipate later developmental procedures.
