This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key of G major, spans an eight-bar sentence structured over a tonic pedal point and concludes firmly in the tonic. It is followed by a connecting episode that initiates a modulation to the dominant key (D major), featuring arpeggiated figuration in that key before proceeding to a further modulation to A major; the conclusion of this episode overlaps with the entrance of the second subject. The second subject, ultimately situated in D major, opens with a four-bar phrase that is immediately repeated; the initial two bars of this repeated phrase remain in A major. At a subsequent point, the bass line from the earlier repetition is transferred to the treble register. The second subject culminates in a full cadential close in the tonic key of G major. The exposition concludes with a transitional passage that, in its initial presentation, leads to the repeat of the entire exposition, and in its subsequent iteration—modified by the addition of two bars and the omission of one—functions as a bridge to the development section.
