This constitutes the Minore (Trio) section in Simple Binary form. The first subject is presented in G minor and modulates to conclude in D minor. This material is followed by a development spanning four bars, which manipulates thematic or harmonic content derived from the opening subject. The first subject then returns in a shortened and altered version in the original key of G minor, now adjusted to cadence firmly in the tonic rather than modulating. The second half of the binary structure—encompassing the development and the altered return of the first subject—is repeated.
