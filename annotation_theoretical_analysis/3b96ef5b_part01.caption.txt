This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The section begins in the tonic key and unfolds as a three-part structure. The first period initiates in the tonic and modulates to the relative minor, culminating in a perfect cadence in D minor; en route, it articulates the dominant harmony (C♯) as a transient harmonic goal. The second period proceeds with a gentle modulation through the minor keys of the mediant and supertonic before effecting a return to the original tonic key. The third period functions as a coda, reasserting the tonic through a dominant pedal point that prepares and reinforces the final cadential confirmation of the home key.
