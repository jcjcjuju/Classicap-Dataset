This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. It begins with a primary theme in E♭ major, the tonic key, which concludes with a perfect cadence. A transition passage follows, modulating from the tonic and culminating in an inverted cadence on F, functioning as the dominant of B♭ major. The secondary theme then appears in B♭ major, the dominant key, presenting a regular second subject. This theme features an interrupted cadence, after which the preceding two bars are varied and repeated, ultimately resolving with a perfect cadence in the dominant. A half-bar link ensues, modulating back to E♭ major and preparing for the repetition of the exposition and subsequent continuation to the next formal section.
