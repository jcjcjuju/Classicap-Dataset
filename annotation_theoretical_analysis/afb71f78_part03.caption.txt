This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, presented in an abridged version that omits its original third section; the first section retains its initial sentence structure with two unequal phrases ending on a half-cadence and a full cadence respectively, while the second section preserves its contrasting song-like character and motivic repetition. The bridge-passage begins with an additional half-bar articulated on an Italian sixth chord and proceeds through a modulation from G minor to F major, mirroring the tonal trajectory of the exposition’s transition from D minor to C major. The second subject is restated in the tonic minor and major, adhering to the dual-key scheme of its initial appearance; its first section unfolds entirely in the tonic minor, concluding with a Picardy third, and the second section, now in the tonic major, features a repeated sentence whose final cadence is significantly extended. The movement concludes with a coda that reintroduces the previously omitted third section of the first subject in its entirety, thereby restoring thematic material initially excluded from the recapitulated first subject.
