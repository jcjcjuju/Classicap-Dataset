This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, remaining otherwise unaltered except for its final bar, which is modified to conclude on the dominant seventh of F major—the key in which the subsequent transition begins. The bridge-passage or transition commences in F major and modulates to C major, thereby preserving the structural correspondence with the exposition’s transition, which originally proceeded from C major to G major. The second subject follows, now transposed to the tonic key, fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of recapitulatory sections in sonata form. A double bar and repeat mark the conclusion of this section, an unusual feature for the second part of a slow movement in sonata form. The movement concludes with a coda that reiterates the opening phrase of the first subject, though with altered harmonic support. This coda initiates with a demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) figure derived from the link preceding the development, introduced first in the bass and then treated sequentially with imitative entry in the treble a beat later. Harmonically, the coda includes a chromatic chord identified as the supertonic seventh (II7) in C major, occurring in the first half of what would be the penultimate bar of the movement.
