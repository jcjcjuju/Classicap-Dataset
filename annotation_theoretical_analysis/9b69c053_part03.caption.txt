This constitutes the recapitulation and coda of a sonata-form movement. The first subject returns in its original tonic key of E major, presented without alteration. This is followed by an episode closely modeled on the earlier transitional passage but modified to conclude in the tonic key rather than modulating to the dominant. The second subject, now transposed into the tonic E major, undergoes extension beginning at its internal midpoint through developmental treatment of material derived from the opening gesture of the first subject; this extended section culminates in a passage grounded in dominant harmony, presented in canon. A final return of the first subject appears in a significantly varied texture: the melodic line is displaced into an inner voice, accompanied by a continuous semiquaver (sixteenth-note) figuration in the treble, and the initial repeat of the first subject’s opening section is omitted. The movement concludes with a coda constructed from previously presented thematic material, prominently featuring the first section of the first subject.
