This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with material derived from the passage immediately preceding the development, transposed into G♭ major and slightly altered. This is followed by the second part of the first subject, now presented in G♭ major. A new thematic figure is then introduced in B minor, preceded by an enharmonic modulation from G♭ to F♯ (the enharmonic equivalent of G♭) occurring over the preceding bars. This new figure undergoes sequential treatment: it is restated in C minor, then in A♭ major, and subsequently in D♭ major. The tonic chord of D♭ major is reinterpreted as a Neapolitan sixth chord in the key of C major, facilitating a modulation that culminates in the presentation of the same figure in C major. Following this, the second part of the first subject returns, now transposed into the key of C major. The development concludes after further modulatory activity, terminating on dominant harmony.
