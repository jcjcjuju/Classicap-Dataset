This constitutes the development section, which is structured in fugue form—an unusual formal choice for a development. The fugal subject, derived from the movement’s first subject, is introduced in A minor and is followed by an answer accompanied by a countersubject. The subject recurs multiple times, with its final segment imitated by an inner voice at the interval of a ninth below. Subsequent entries of the subject appear in varied contexts, including a statement beginning in the same key and another commencing in C major. Between these expositions, episodic material is developed: one episode is constructed from a fragment of the subject, while the next draws upon the initial thematic figure. A notable instance of consecutive fifths occurs at the conclusion of one subject entry. Following an extended episode, the texture intensifies through a stretto, wherein the subject is presented in overlapping entries. The fugue concludes with a canonical allusion to the subject and resolves onto a dominant pedal point; this is succeeded by four bars of arpeggiated figuration outlining the dominant chord, which functions as a retransition to the recapitulation.
