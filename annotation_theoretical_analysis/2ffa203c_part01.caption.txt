This constitutes the exposition of a binary-form structure featuring a repeated first section. The opening eight-bar first subject is presented in the tonic key of D minor; it comprises two four-bar phrases, the first concluding firmly in D minor and the second modulating to begin in F major before cadencing in A minor, thereby establishing the dominant minor as a secondary tonal area. Following the double bar and repeat, the music proceeds to an episode built upon a dominant pedal point, which sustains harmonic tension through prolonged emphasis on the dominant scale degree. This is succeeded by a restatement of the first subject in its original tonic key, now modified in its latter portion to achieve a conclusive cadence in D minor rather than modulating to A minor. The entire latter portion—from the episode through this altered return of the first subject—is enclosed within a repeat structure, reinforcing the binary design through literal repetition of its second half.
