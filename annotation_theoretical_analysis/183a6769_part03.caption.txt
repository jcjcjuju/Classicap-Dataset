This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject reappears in F major, the subdominant, a highly unusual tonal choice that preserves the original fifth-related intervallic relationship between the first and second subjects as established in the exposition. This structural device ensures that the second subject will again appear a fifth higher than the first subject’s recapitulated key, thereby maintaining proportional tonal correspondence between exposition and recapitulation. The transition follows, significantly altered from its initial presentation: it is lengthened through the literal repetition of its opening phrase, now with inverted voice leading, and modulates decisively to the tonic key, C major. The second subject then returns firmly in the tonic, fulfilling the conventional tonal resolution of sonata form. A brief codetta concludes the section, reaffirming the tonic and providing structural closure. The entire recapitulation is marked for repetition.
