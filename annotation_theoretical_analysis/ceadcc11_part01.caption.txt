This constitutes the exposition of a binary-form prelude, comprising two distinct periods that establish and then depart from the relative major before returning to the tonic. The first period presents thematic material derived primarily from quaver and semiquaver figures introduced at the outset, culminating in a perfect cadence in the relative major, E♭. This section is followed by a repeat, reinforcing its structural autonomy. The second period begins in the same relative major but initiates a modulatory trajectory through the related keys of C minor, A♭ major, and F minor, ultimately resolving back to the tonic key. Throughout both periods, sequential treatment of the initial motivic material is a defining feature, with voice exchange, contrary motion, and ornamental elaboration contributing to the developmental character of the passage.
