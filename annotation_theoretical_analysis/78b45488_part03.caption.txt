This constitutes a da capo reprise of Menuetto I, thereby reaffirming the ternary design established in Part I. The section presents a sentence structure in B flat major, initially modulating to F major, followed by a chromatic transitional passage that reestablishes the tonic key, and concluding with a modified restatement of the opening sentence entirely in B flat major. The initial phrase ends on an inverted cadence in the tonic, while the consequent phrase concludes with a perfect cadence in the dominant; the final restatement features an inversion of the opening motif and a slightly extended after-phrase adjusted to terminate with a perfect cadence in the tonic.
