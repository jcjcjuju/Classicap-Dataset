This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, is structured as a ten-bar sentence comprising two phrases: the first phrase concludes with a cadential articulation, and the second phrase begins an octave lower, restating the opening material while expanding its length to six bars. A bridge passage follows, effecting a modulation to the dominant key (G major), which is confirmed by Bar 14; this transition culminates in a half-cadence in the dominant. The second subject, situated in the dominant key, opens with a motive based on the skip of a perfect fourth—a feature shared with the first subject. Its first section unfolds over sixteen bars and initiates with a descending sequence wherein the opening two-bar idea is imitated twice, each time a third lower than the preceding entry; Bars 34–36 further develop this sequential technique through a descending tonal sequence. The second section of the second subject is largely constructed from modified repetitions of its initial two-bar module. Within this section, the semiquaver figuration shifts to the treble voice, and the melodic line is derived from specific notes within each four-note group: initially the first and fourth notes (Bars 44–46), and later the second and fourth notes (Bars 48–49 and 52–53). The exposition concludes with a double bar and is marked for repetition.
