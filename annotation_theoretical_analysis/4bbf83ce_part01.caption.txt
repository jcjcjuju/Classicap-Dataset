This constitutes the exposition of a binary-form prelude. The first period begins in G sharp minor and modulates to its relative major, B major, by the fourth bar. En route, it briefly touches upon F sharp minor and C sharp minor before returning to the tonic minor. This period concludes with a perfect cadence in the dominant minor, D sharp minor, thereby establishing a clear tonal trajectory from tonic to dominant. The second period commences in D sharp minor, presenting the principal thematic material in the bass voice. It ultimately returns to the tonic key, where a coda is constructed upon the bass presentation of the theme. This coda culminates in a plagal cadence, with the final chord articulated as a Tierce de Picardie, thus resolving the movement in the parallel major. Throughout both periods, the foundational motivic figure introduced at the outset is deployed at structurally significant points, including in the bass at the inception of the second period and later in imitative counterpoint. Cadential articulations subdivide each period: the first at the relative major, the second at the subdominant minor.
