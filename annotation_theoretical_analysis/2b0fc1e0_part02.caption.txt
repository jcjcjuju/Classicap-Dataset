This constitutes the second episode of a rondo form, functioning as a developmental digression in the relative minor. The episode is thematically derived from the principal subject, which it presents initially in inversion, accompanied by a new semiquaver figuration in the treble. This opening gesture is immediately followed by a passage in which the voices are re-inverted, preserving the thematic contour while altering the contrapuntal disposition. The subsequent phrase culminates in a half-cadence articulated by an augmented sixth chord in A minor, a cadential formula that is then reiterated and extended. Following this prolongation, the earlier material returns in a modified statement, with the initial four bars once again subjected to inversion. The episode concludes with a full cadence in A minor, underpinned by two strategic harmonic interventions: a Neapolitan sixth chord appears both in the transient modulation through D minor—where it resolves as the first inversion of the submediant—and again near the close, reinforcing the minor-mode tonality. A brief link follows, cadencing on the dominant seventh of C major to prepare the return of the principal subject.
