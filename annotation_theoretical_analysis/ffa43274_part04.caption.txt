This constitutes the coda of the movement. It presents a final statement of the first subject theme, now firmly in the tonic key of A major, and is sustained above a tonic pedal throughout. The thematic material retains its lyrical character, as established in the exposition, and serves to reaffirm the tonal stability of the home key, providing a conclusive close to the movement.
