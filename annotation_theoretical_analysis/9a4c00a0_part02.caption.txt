This constitutes the first large formal section of a movement that combines multiple formal principles, functioning as an extended exposition with fugal and episodic characteristics. It begins with the presentation of a first subject in the tonic key of B flat major, treated fugally over an extended span. The subject is initially stated in its complete form and is followed by a tonal answer, with the final two notes altered, accompanied by the introduction of a counter-subject. A subsequent statement of the subject appears in the tonic key in the bass, slightly abbreviated, immediately succeeded by the counter-subject in the treble. This fugal exposition is followed by an episode constructed from transformations of the subject, counter-subject, and a preceding codetta, modulating to A flat major for a further entry of the subject in the treble. A second episode ensues, derived from the concluding portion of the subject and a segment of the counter-subject, partially rendered in double counterpoint, culminating in a cadence in G flat major. This is succeeded by a sequence of imitative entries based on a motivic figure, progressing from G flat major to E flat minor, which prepares the return of the first subject. Rather than reappearing in the tonic key—as would be conventional in a rondo—the subject re-enters in E flat minor, presented in augmented form, and is partially answered in the treble; a further response follows in the bass by inversion. The section concludes in D flat major, thereby avoiding a tonic resolution and establishing a tonally unstable close that diverges from standard formal expectations.
