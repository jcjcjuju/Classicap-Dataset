This constitutes the exposition and subsequent modulatory preparation for the fugato section of a prelude structured around a recurring ornamental figure. The opening period establishes a harmonic trajectory by concluding with a perfect cadence in the dominant key. The following extended period begins in G♯ major and undertakes a series of modulations: it progresses to D♯ minor, then to its relative minor A♯ minor, and continues through a gradual harmonic unfolding that touches upon the subdominant (F♯), returns to D♯ minor and G♯ major, and explores F♯ major before ultimately resolving with a perfect cadence in the tonic key, C♯. A brief modulatory passage ensues, culminating in a perfect cadence on the dominant (G♯), which functions as a dominant pedal point leading into the fugato. The fugato, set in 3/8 meter and cast in three-part texture, commences in G♯ and directs harmonic motion toward the tonic, achieving a momentary perfect cadence in C♯. It then shifts toward the dominant (G♯) again, before navigating through A♯ minor and D♯ minor en route to a final return to the original key.
