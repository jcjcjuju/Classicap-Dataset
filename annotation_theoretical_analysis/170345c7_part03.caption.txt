This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of C major, presented in a shortened version wherein the varied repetition of its concluding phrase is omitted. The connecting episode follows, significantly altered from its initial appearance: the opening brilliant passage is excised and replaced by a developmental treatment of the final two bars of the first subject, while the latter portion of the episode remains unchanged. The second subject then appears transposed to the tonic minor and major, unfolding first in C minor and subsequently in C major. The movement concludes with a coda that reintroduces the thematic material first presented at the outset of the exposition’s coda; this is followed by an arpeggiated passage leading to a cadenza, after which the movement closes with a final allusion to the first subject.
