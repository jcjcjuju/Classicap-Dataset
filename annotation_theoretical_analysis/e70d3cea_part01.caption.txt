This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. It opens with a five-bar introduction that precedes the first subject. The first subject proper begins in the tonic key of C sharp minor and concludes in E major, establishing a departure from the home key. A connecting episode follows, spanning the transition from E minor to B minor; this passage simultaneously fulfills the formal role of a bridge while exhibiting characteristics that align it with a continuation of the first subject. The second subject then commences in B major and modulates to F sharp minor by its conclusion, adhering to the convention of presenting secondary thematic material in a key other than the tonic.
