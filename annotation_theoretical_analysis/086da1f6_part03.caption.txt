This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject appears in D major rather than in the tonic key of F major. The connecting episode returns, incorporating modulatory material derived from the first subject, and is followed by the second and third sections of the first subject now transposed to the tonic key. The second subject is presented in F major, the tonic key, and includes a sequential passage based on its opening phrase that was absent in the exposition. The movement concludes with a coda in which the final cadence is repeated. Notably, the entire development and recapitulation are marked for repetition, an unusual formal procedure.
