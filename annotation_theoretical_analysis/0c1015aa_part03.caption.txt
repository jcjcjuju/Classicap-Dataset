This constitutes the recapitulatory third part of a sonata-rondo form. It begins with the return of the first subject in the tonic key of C major, presented with varied elongation. This is followed by an episode whose final five bars are altered to cadence on G rather than D, thereby adjusting the harmonic trajectory relative to its earlier appearance. The second subject then reappears transposed into the tonic key of C major; its first portion is elongated by two bars, while its latter portion remains in the same key as previously presented, albeit with slight variation. A transitional passage ensues, functioning as preparation for the final entry of the first subject. This last appearance of the first subject is abbreviated and serves as a coda, omitting the full return of the second subject. Within this coda, inverted pedal points occur, and a prolonged interrupted cadence features a dominant seventh chord whose fifth is chromatically raised from D to D♯, resolving deceptively to an A major chord.
