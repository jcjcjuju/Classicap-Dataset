This constitutes the recapitulatory statement of the principal theme followed by a coda. The principal theme returns in its entirety in the tonic key of A major, presenting the same melodic and harmonic structure as its initial appearance: a balanced eight-bar period concluding with a full cadence, followed by a four-bar phrase that transiently modulates to the dominant key of E major, and then a restatement of material from the opening melody leading to a cadential link. The subsequent coda is thematically derived from the episode, yet it incorporates subtle reminiscences of the principal subject through demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) figuration that evoke its characteristic gestures, particularly at the approach to the final cadence.
