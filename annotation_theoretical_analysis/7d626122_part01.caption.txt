This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first period begins in the tonic key of A major and modulates toward the dominant, culminating in a cadence in E major. The second period commences with the thematic material presented in inversion in the dominant key, subsequently touching upon B minor and prolonging the relative minor (F♯ minor) before returning to the tonic key, where it concludes with a perfect cadence in A major. The third period reproduces the opening thematic material in the tonic key through similar motion, while incorporating brief tonal excursions to the subdominant major (D major), B minor, and D major, ultimately reaffirming the tonic with another perfect cadence. A brief coda follows, anchored by a tonic pedal that solidifies the home key.
