This constitutes the second part of a binary form, itself structured as a simple binary. The first section presents a first subject in C major, concluding with a cadence in G major. A repeat sign indicates the entire section is to be restated. The subsequent episode unfolds over a sustained pedal point on G, functioning as the dominant of the prevailing key area. This is followed by a return of the first subject in its original key, now reaffirmed in C major. The part concludes with a connecting passage that modulates from the closing point of the preceding statement back to the tonic key of E minor, thereby preparing the eventual return to the home key of the overall movement.
