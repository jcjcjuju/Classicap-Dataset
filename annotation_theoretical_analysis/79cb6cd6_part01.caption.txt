This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a fugue in B flat minor. The exposition begins with the subject stated in the alto in the tonic key of B flat minor, followed by a real answer in the treble in the dominant key of F minor, accompanied by a countersubject in the alto. A brief codetta leads to a restatement of the subject in the bass in the tonic, again with the countersubject in the alto, followed by another codetta. The exposition concludes with the answer in the tenor in F minor, supported by the countersubject in the bass. This is succeeded by Episode I, which modulates from F minor through D flat major back to B flat minor. A stretto then ensues (Stretto I), with the subject in the tenor and the answer entering at the interval of a seventh below in the alto, both in B flat minor.

The modulatory section opens with a codetta effecting a modulation from B flat minor to D flat major, followed by the subject in the treble and its answer in the bass (Stretto II), both in D flat major. Episode II then modulates from D flat major back toward B flat minor. The fugue proceeds with an inverted answer in the tenor in B flat minor, accompanied by an inverted countersubject in the alto; this is followed by an inverted subject in the alto in E flat minor with an inverted countersubject in the tenor. After a codetta, the inverted subject appears in the treble in B flat minor with the inverted countersubject in the alto, followed by another codetta. The inverted answer then enters in the bass in A flat minor, with the second part of the inverted countersubject in the treble. Episode III follows, modulating from A flat minor through E flat minor to B flat minor. This leads to Stretto III, featuring the inverted subject in the tenor and the inverted answer in the treble, both in B flat minor, followed by a codetta. Stretto IV then presents the inverted subject in the alto in F minor and the inverted answer in the bass. A final codetta precedes Stretto V, which states the inverted subject in the treble in A flat major against the answer in the tenor in similar motion (not inverted), followed by Episode IV, which modulates through E flat minor back to B
