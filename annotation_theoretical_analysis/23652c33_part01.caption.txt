This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of B♭ major and is structured in two sections: the initial phrase concludes within the first five measures, followed by a second phrase that ends on the dominant harmony; this latter phrase is then repeated and extended to achieve a full authentic cadence in the tonic. A connecting episode follows, initiated by a two-bar thematic idea that undergoes three sequential repetitions with varied harmonic treatment. This is succeeded by a passage in octaves that culminates on the dominant, which then facilitates a modulation to D major through rhythmic material derived from the opening phrase of the first subject. The harmonic preparation continues with sustained emphasis on the dominant chord of G major, establishing that key for a subsequent episodic passage that leads directly into the second subject.  

The second subject appears in G major, with its melodic line initially situated in an inner voice; its opening motif is motivically linked to the final three bass notes of the preceding episode. The initial five-bar segment of the second subject is immediately repeated, though the repetition is altered to conclude in E minor. A sequential passage ensues, modulating through D minor, C major, B minor, A major, and finally returning to G major. This is followed by a two-bar phrase in G major—repeated—then two bars that modulate to D major; these six bars are subsequently restated in different octaves. Another sequential passage leads to a modulation to C major, where a new motivic figure is introduced before yielding to a final four-bar phrase in G major that concludes the second subject.  

A coda follows, beginning with a new six-bar thematic idea that is immediately repeated in varied form. This section closes with a passage initiated by the dominant seventh chord of C major, ultimately resolving to G major. A brief transitional passage then leads to the repeat of the entire exposition, after which a short link prepares the entrance of the development section.
