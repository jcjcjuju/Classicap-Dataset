This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of E flat major, though its opening harmony is altered: the initial two bars present an F minor harmony rather than the third inversion of the eleventh chord (with root B flat) that opened the exposition. The connecting episode follows, reappearing without the motivic reference to the first subject found in the exposition; it concludes on the dominant (B flat) rather than on F, thereby preparing for the return of the second subject in the tonic. The second subject is now presented in E flat major, and the intervening connecting passage—originally spanning Bars 53–56 in the exposition—is both varied and extended. The movement concludes with a coda that begins as a transposition of the expositional coda into the tonic key and is further expanded through material derived from the first subject.
