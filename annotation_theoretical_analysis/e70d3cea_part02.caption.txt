This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage is notably concise and features minimal thematic elaboration, containing only a single, slight reference to the first subject. The majority of the section—twelve bars in duration—is structured over a dominant pedal point, which ultimately resolves to reaffirm the tonic key at its close.
