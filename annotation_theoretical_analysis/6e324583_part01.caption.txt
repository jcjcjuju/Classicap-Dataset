This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in E flat major. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the bass in the tonic key, followed by a tonal answer in the tenor in the dominant (B flat major), with no counter-subject. A brief codetta modulates back to E flat major, after which the subject reappears in the alto in the tonic, followed by another tonal answer in the treble in the dominant. The modulatory section opens with Episode I, which prolongs and confirms the dominant key of B flat major. This is followed by an answer in the tenor in E flat major, immediately overlapped by Stretto I, in which the subject enters in the bass while the answer is still ongoing—both in the tonic. The alto then presents another answer in E flat major, which is itself overlapped by Stretto II, featuring the subject in the treble, again in the tonic. Episode II follows, modulating from E flat major through C minor and returning to E flat major, employing motivic material derived from the subject alongside a new eighth-note figure introduced for textural variety. The subject then reappears in an altered form in the tenor. The recapitulatory section commences with an answer in the treble in B flat major, overlapped by Stretto III, in which the subject enters in the bass in E flat major. The movement concludes with a coda in the tonic that incorporates a final reference to a characteristic portion of the subject in its closing bars.
