This constitutes the development section of the movement, marked *Presto con fuoco*, which introduces a stark contrast in character, tempo, dynamics, and texture relative to the preceding material. It is structured into two main subsections. The first subsection presents a turbulent theme in A minor, characterized by an almost constant semiquaver pulse, wide registral usage, and a brusque melodic motif in the left hand that ascends rapidly using quaver rhythms, primarily outlining the tonic triad with neighbor-note embellishments. Harmonically, the opening six bars employ only tonic and diminished seventh chords over a tonic pedal, with the tonic chord initially colored by an added sixth (F), creating a momentary illusion of F major before resolving to confirm A minor. Cross-rhythms intensify the turbulence: the right hand groups notes in crotchets while the left hand employs dotted quaver groupings. The passage modulates to G minor via a diminished seventh chord (F♯–A–C–E♭), and the entire thematic complex is then transposed down a tone to G minor, culminating in a motion toward D minor through a half-diminished seventh chord (E♮–G–B♭–D). The second subsection initiates a sequential ascent through D minor and F minor toward A♭ minor, marked by increasing volume and the introduction of a driving dotted quaver–semiquaver–quaver rhythmic motif that contrasts sharply with the lilting *Siciliana* rhythm of the opening. The climax is articulated by a German augmented sixth chord (F♭–A♭–C♭–D♮), which resolves to the dominant of A♭ minor. A retransition follows, remaining in A♭ minor with a dominant or dominant seventh chord at the start of each bar, accompanied by a gradual diminuendo, registral descent, and relaxation of the continuous semiquaver motion. The final bars of this section feature a series of first-inversion major triads leading to a C major chord, which functions as the dominant seventh of F major, while the tempo concurrently decreases, preparing for the return of the primary thematic material.
