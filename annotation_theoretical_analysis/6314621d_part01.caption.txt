This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of G major, structured as an eight-bar sentence followed by a four-bar continuation; the latter half of the initial sentence is then restated, leading to a full cadence in the tonic. An episode follows, commencing with a four-bar introductory passage that establishes G minor. This is succeeded by a four-bar phrase concluding in D minor, which is then repeated with variation and extension, ultimately modulating to and cadencing in B♭ major. A brief connecting passage ensues, preparing the arrival of the second subject, which appears not in the expected dominant (D major) but in the mediant-related key of B♭ major. Within this second subject, its final phrase is repeated immediately after its initial statement. A subsequent episode replicates the earlier episode in full, though its closing bars are altered to cadence in G minor rather than B♭ major. Another short connecting passage leads to the complete restatement of the first subject in its original tonic key.
