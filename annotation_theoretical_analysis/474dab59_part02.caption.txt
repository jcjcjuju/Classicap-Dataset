This constitutes the development section of the movement. It introduces a third subject rooted in A minor, constructed almost entirely from the motivic figure first presented at its inception. The subject modulates to C major, culminating in a full cadence in that key. A subsequent imitative passage ensues, leading to a cadence in E major. Following this, material derived from the opening of the third subject returns with slight variation, succeeded by a recurrence of the imitative passage; however, its concluding gesture is altered to cadence on the dominant of the tonic key. The section closes with a transitional passage that modulates toward the tonic, preparing the return of thematic material in the following section.
