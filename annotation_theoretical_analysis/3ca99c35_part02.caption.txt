This constitutes a developmental episode that functions as a transitional passage within the movement’s overarching form. The episode is derived motivically from the earlier episode in the first part, retaining its foundational figure while undergoing significant harmonic and melodic transformation. Though rooted in the same structural gesture, its treatment here diverges through reharmonization and altered melodic contour, thereby creating a sense of variation rather than literal repetition. The harmonic language introduces new tonal implications distinct from the prior episode’s trajectory from C sharp minor to B minor, though specific key areas are not explicitly stated in this segment. The melodic content, while referencing the original figuration, is reshaped to serve the episodic function of destabilizing tonal focus and generating forward momentum toward the subsequent return of the first subject.
