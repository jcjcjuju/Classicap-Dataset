This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in B minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the alto in the tonic key of B minor, followed by a short codetta; this is succeeded by a tonal answer in the treble in the dominant key of F♯ minor, with a codetta modulating back to B minor. The subject then reappears in the bass in the tonic, after which Episode I modulates from B minor to F♯ minor. The exposition concludes with an answer in the alto in F♯ minor, now accompanied for the first time by the counter-subject in the bass. The modulatory section commences with Episode II, which effects a modulation from F♯ minor to D major, where the subject appears in the treble with the counter-subject in the alto. Episode III then modulates from D major to A major, leading to a statement of the subject in the bass with the counter-subject in the treble. Episode IV modulates from A major back to F♯ minor, followed by an answer in the alto with the counter-subject in the treble. Episode V modulates from F♯ minor to B minor, after which the subject appears in the alto without the counter-subject. This is immediately overlapped by Stretto I, in which the subject enters in the bass in E minor, again without the counter-subject. Episode VI then modulates from E minor back to B minor. The recapitulatory section opens with the subject in the treble in the tonic key of B minor, unaccompanied by the counter-subject. A coda follows, during which the subject reappears in the alto, again without counter-subject, and is simultaneously overlapped by Stretto II in the bass. The movement concludes with a final statement of the subject in the treble, ornamented by passing notes, all within the tonic key of B minor.
