This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of G major and is structured as a sentence spanning eight bars, followed by an eight-bar passage constructed entirely over a dominant seventh chord. This initial thematic statement then reappears in a curtailed form of six bars. The second subject follows in E minor and is organized in four-bar phrases, derived from its initial four-bar idea; it modulates to A minor and concludes with a dominant seventh chord that ultimately resolves to G major. The first subject then returns in its original tonic key, restating its thematic material without modulation. This second statement of the first subject is succeeded by an eight-bar harmonic preparation consisting solely of the dominant seventh chord, which functions as a dominant prolongation leading to the subsequent third subject.
