This constitutes the exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory section of a fugue in D minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the treble in the tonic key of D minor, followed by a real answer in the alto in the dominant key of A major, accompanied by a countersubject in the treble. A codetta derived from the countersubject ensues, after which the subject reappears in the bass in the tonic, with the countersubject initially in the treble and its second limb transferred to the alto. The modulatory section commences with an irregularly positioned statement of the subject in the treble over a tonic pedal, followed by Episode I, which modulates from D minor to A major through a descending sequence. Fragmentary and altered entries of the subject and its inversion appear, including a chromatically altered subject fragment in the bass (with E♭ replacing F) and an inverted answer in the alto. A stretto (Stretto I, incomplete) emerges with the subject in the treble and its inversion in the alto, supported by an ascending sequential figure in the bass. Further stretto entries follow, with successive subject statements in the bass and alto, culminating in a cadence in A major. Additional subject entries occur in the bass and treble with countersubjectal material, and Stretto III (incomplete) features an inverted answer in the treble. The subject by inversion appears in the bass in D minor, accompanied by the countersubject in the treble, preceding Episode II, which modulates from D minor to G minor. In G minor, the inverted subject appears in the bass and is answered by inversion in the treble, forming Stretto IV (the only complete stretto), which resolves in A major. Subsequent entries include the subject in the alto and its inversion in the bass, leading through G minor back toward D minor via Episode III, which modulates through F major. An incomplete subject entry in the alto in D minor is followed by another in the bass, initiating Stretto V (incomplete). Episode IV then modulates from G minor to D minor. The recapitulatory section presents the subject in the bass in the tonic key, immediately followed by the subject in the alto in an incomplete stretto (Stretto VI). The movement concludes with a coda in D minor featuring a tonic pedal, over which the final chord is rendered major through
