This constitutes the development section of the sonata form, functioning as the “working out” portion of the movement. It is comprised of a passage built entirely upon dominant harmony sustained over a dominant pedal point, creating harmonic tension without thematic elaboration or modulation. The texture and harmonic stasis emphasize prolongation of the dominant function, preparing for the subsequent return of the tonic key in the recapitulation.
