This constitutes the exposition, modulatory, and recapitulatory sections of a tonal fugue in F sharp major. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the treble in the tonic key, followed by a tonal answer in the alto in C sharp minor, accompanied by a counter-subject in the treble. The subject then appears in the bass, now accompanied by a counter-subject in the alto in F sharp minor. This is succeeded by Episode I, which introduces a new characteristic figure and modulates from F sharp major to C sharp major. The exposition concludes with a restatement of the subject in the treble, accompanied by the counter-subject in the alto, now firmly in F sharp major. The modulatory section commences with Episode II, which modulates from F sharp major to C sharp major; this is followed by an answer in the alto in C sharp major with a counter-subject in the bass. Episode III then modulates from C sharp major to D sharp minor, leading to a statement of the subject in the bass with a partial counter-subject in the alto, cadencing in D sharp minor. Episode IV follows, modulating from D sharp minor to B major, after which the subject appears in the alto in B major, but the usual counter-subject in the treble is replaced by the characteristic episodic figure. The section closes with imitative entries of the subject in the treble and alto, accompanied by a new bass figure. The recapitulatory section presents the subject once again in the treble in the tonic key of F sharp major, now accompanied by the counter-subject in the bass, and concludes with a coda based entirely on the characteristic episodic figure, remaining in F sharp major.
