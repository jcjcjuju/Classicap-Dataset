This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in G major (tonic) and comprises an eight-bar sentence that remains entirely within the tonic key, with the first four bars unified by identical rhythmic content. This is followed by a melodious connecting episode, whose final six bars are constructed over a pedal point on A; this pedal is approached by a gradually ascending bass line from G to the ninth above, while the melody simultaneously unfolds in sequential patterns. The second subject appears in D major (dominant key) and consists of two four-bar sections: the first concludes on a dominant seventh chord, while the second cadences on the D major triad, immediately overlapping with a one-bar phrase that is repeated three times—the third iteration altered to terminate in A major. This same one-bar phrase recurs once more, initiating a modulation to G major, which is subsequently followed by a transitional passage that reestablishes D major. The exposition concludes with a coda comprising new thematic material functioning as a supplementary subject. The entire exposition is marked for literal repetition.
