This constitutes a development section preceded by an atypical formal interpolation: the second entry of the first subject appears before the development proper, a structural anomaly noted as exceptionally rare in sonata-form practice. The first subject, upon its second appearance, is presented in the tonic key, maintaining its original thematic identity. The subsequent development section commences with an expanded version of the transition theme, initially rooted in the tonic but soon modulating to the tonic minor, then proceeding through F major and A minor. A sequential passage follows, with Bars 85–86 forming a direct sequence of Bars 84–85. From Bar 88, a modulatory sequence derived from the second section of the second subject is introduced, characterized by semiquaver figures transferred to the bass. This sequence traverses A major, G major, F major, D minor, and ultimately G minor, with each modulation executed through an inversion of the dominant minor ninth chord. The second portion of the development is motivically grounded in the opening idea of the movement. It begins with an inversion of the initial bars of the second subject, followed by an inverted treatment of the latter portion of the first subject, which modulates from G minor to A minor. A contrapuntal episode ensues, featuring imitation between treble and bass at the interval of a fifth below, with overlapping entries forming a rising sequential pattern. At the culmination of this imitative passage, the latter portion of the motive is excised and supplanted by a return to the arpeggiated accompaniment figure. The development concludes with an exact restatement of the final bars of the original transition theme.
