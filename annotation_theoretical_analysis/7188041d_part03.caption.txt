This constitutes a da capo reprise of the First Part followed by a coda. The reprise presents the First Part in its entirety: it opens with the first subject in E minor (tonic), followed by a developmental section, then a restatement of the first subject in the original tonic key, and concludes with a coda in E major. This final coda features a figure derived from the first subject, presented five times over a tonic pedal.
