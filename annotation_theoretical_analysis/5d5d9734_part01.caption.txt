This constitutes the exposition and subsequent developmental-recapitulatory section of a binary-form prelude that exhibits incipient sonata-form tendencies. The first period establishes the tonic key of F minor and modulates to its relative major, A♭ major, concluding with a perfect cadence in that key. Within this span, a dominant pedal in the tonic is sustained, followed later by a dominant pedal of the relative major, reinforcing the tonal shift. The second period begins in A♭ major but quickly embarks on a series of modulations: it moves to E♭ major, then to B♭ minor, and briefly touches upon D♭ major. A momentary arrival on the dominant of the tonic key precedes a sequential passage that drives the harmony back toward F minor, culminating in a perfect cadence in the tonic. The movement concludes with a coda that firmly confirms the tonic key through harmonic and cadential reinforcement. Throughout, thematic material from the opening is transposed, varied, and reintroduced in a manner that suggests both binary symmetry and an emergent sonata-form logic, particularly through the delayed but clear recapitulation of the opening subject and the use of sequential modulation to articulate tonal departure and return.
