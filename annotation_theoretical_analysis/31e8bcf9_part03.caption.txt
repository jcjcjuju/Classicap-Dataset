This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with new thematic material not derived from the exposition. Subsequently, the second subject is presented in B major, initially stated in the bass and then imitated in the treble. Near the close of the development, a motivic reference to the first subject emerges, functioning as a retransition that directly leads to the return of the first subject in the recapitulation.
