This constitutes the exposition of a binary form, comprising two distinct periods. The first period establishes the tonic key through imitative counterpoint in the two upper voices over a moving bass, subsequently modulating to the relative major before briefly touching upon the dominant and concluding with a half cadence in the tonic. A short coda follows this cadence. The second period employs sequential treatment of a motivic figure—shorter in duration than that of the first period, articulated in eighth notes rather than quarter notes—and progresses through a series of modulations across various keys. This period culminates in a Picardy third, affirming a major-mode resolution, and is followed by a brief coda that parallels the structural function of the earlier coda in the first period.
