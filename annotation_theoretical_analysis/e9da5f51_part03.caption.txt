This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, with its initial half ornamented in a manner typical of slow movements. Its closing gesture diverges from the exposition: instead of the repeated tonic chord, it concludes with a repetition of the last inversion of the dominant seventh chord in A flat major, thereby transforming the cadence into a transitional link. This harmonic reinterpretation initiates a bridge passage that modulates from A flat major through F minor to E flat major—the tonic—mirroring the original transition’s tonal relationship (E flat to B flat) but transposed to reflect the recapitulatory context. The second subject then appears in the tonic key, fulfilling the formal requirement of thematic resolution within the home key.
