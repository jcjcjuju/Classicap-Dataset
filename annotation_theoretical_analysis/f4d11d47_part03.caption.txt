This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, presented without alteration. It is followed by a bridge-passage or transition that initially mirrors the structure of its exposition counterpart but is subsequently lengthened by four bars through the insertion of a real sequence. The latter portion of this transition is modified to effect a modulation that leads directly to the second subject in the tonic key rather than the dominant. The second subject then appears transposed to the tonic, preserving its internal phrase structure and varied repetition as established in the exposition. Finally, the codetta reappears, slightly extended in length, and draws motivically upon material from the opening of the first subject as well as earlier semiquaver figuration. The entire recapitulation is marked for repetition.
