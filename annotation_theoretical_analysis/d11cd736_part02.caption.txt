This constitutes an episode functioning as a transitional section. The passage begins and remains within the key of the dominant, ultimately concluding in that same key before effecting a modulation back to the tonic key in its final bar. The harmonic trajectory thus outlines a departure from and return to the tonic via the dominant, with the modulation serving to reestablish the home key for the subsequent formal section.
