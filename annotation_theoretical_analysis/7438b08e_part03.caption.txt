This constitutes a literal reprise of the First Part in simple binary form. It begins with a sixteen-bar first subject in D major, comprising two eight-bar phrases: the initial phrase concludes with a half-close on the dominant, while the second achieves a full close in the tonic key. This is followed by a nine-bar modulating episode structured as a three-bar subject answered at the fourth above, omitting the subject’s initial note. The first subject then returns in the tonic key, varied and extended, with its opening three bars underpinned by an inverted pedal point on the dominant. The section concludes with a coda.
