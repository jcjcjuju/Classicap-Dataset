This constitutes the exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory stretti of a five-voice tonal fugue in B flat minor. The exposition presents the subject in the first treble in the tonic key of B flat minor, followed by a tonal answer in the second treble transposed to the dominant, F minor; this alternation between tonic and dominant continues with a codetta, after which the subject reappears in the alto in B flat minor, answered by the tenor in F minor, and concluded by a final statement of the subject in the bass in the tonic. The modulatory section commences with Episode I, which effects a modulation from B flat minor to D flat major through sequential treatment of the second limb of the subject; this is followed by a statement of the subject in D flat major in the first treble, an answer in E flat minor in the second treble, a return of the subject in B flat minor in the tenor, and an answer in E flat minor in the bass, culminating in a codetta. A further answer appears in the alto in D flat major before Episode II initiates a sequential modulation through A flat and E flat to B flat. Subsequently, two answers in B flat minor occur in the tenor and bass, leading into Stretto I, a complete stretto in E flat minor involving overlapping entries of the answer in the first and second treble, subject in the alto, altered answer in the bass, and answer in the tenor, followed by a combined statement of subject in the second treble and answer in the alto, all in E flat minor. Episode III then modulates from E flat minor back to the tonic B flat minor. The recapitulatory section features Stretto II, a complete stretto in the tonic B flat minor with dense contrapuntal layering: the subject enters in the first treble, immediately overlapped by the answer in the second treble and subject in the alto, followed by the answer in the tenor and subject in the bass. The movement concludes with a coda that includes a reminiscence of the first limb of the answer in the alto and the second limb of the subject in the first treble, succeeded by a fragment of the subject’s second limb in the alto, and terminates with a Tierce de Picardie in B flat major.
