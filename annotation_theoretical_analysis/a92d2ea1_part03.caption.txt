This constitutes a literal restatement of the First Part in its entirety, thereby reaffirming the initial Simple Binary Form structure. The section opens with the first subject in F major (tonic), which modulates to and concludes in C major (dominant); this first subject is repeated in full. Following the double bar and repeat, a brief coda ensues, reiterating the material of the ninth bar an octave higher and then restating it once more in the tonic key of F. A development section follows, commencing with imitative treatment of a figure derived from the second and third bars of the first subject; at its midpoint, a new motivic idea is introduced and imitated in the bass, after which the remainder of the development draws exclusively upon referential material from the first subject. The first subject then returns, though only its second portion is presented, now varied and sustained over a dominant pedal point, followed again by a double bar and repeat. The section concludes with an extended coda that initiates with a vigorous imitative passage based on the fifth bar of the first subject, incorporates several episodes in contrary motion, and culminates with the transposition of the original dominant-key closing phrase of the first subject into the tonic key of F.
