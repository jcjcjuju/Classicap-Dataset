This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, nominally in E minor (the tonic key), exhibits minimal tonal stability in that key. It opens with a phrase that begins in the tonic and modulates to G major; this phrase is immediately restated, now commencing in G major and concluding in B minor. A subsequent phrase initiates in G major and culminates in a pause on the dominant chord of E minor, which is then followed by a four-bar passage firmly in the tonic key; this latter passage is repeated and concludes with a full cadence in E minor. Notably, aside from this brief allusion to the relative major (G major) within the first subject, the relative major key does not otherwise appear in the movement. The connecting episode begins in the tonic key and proceeds through a four-bar segment in C major, which is then transposed and restated in A minor. A further iteration of this material appears in B-flat major, leading to a modulation into B minor via the dominant minor ninth chord, which directly prepares the entrance of the second subject. The second subject is presented in B minor—a departure from the conventional relative major—and consists of a five-bar phrase that is varied upon repetition. The exposition concludes with a coda.
