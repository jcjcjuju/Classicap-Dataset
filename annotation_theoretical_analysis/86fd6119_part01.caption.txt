This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a fugue in D minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the alto in the tonic key of D minor, followed by a real answer in the treble in the dominant key of A minor, accompanied by a countersubject in the alto. A codetta modulates from A minor back to D minor, after which the subject reappears in the bass in the tonic. The modulatory section commences with Episode I, which modulates from D minor through F major and returns to D minor; this episode introduces a new motivic figure that is freely imitated across voices. The subject then appears in fragmented form in the bass and treble, both times without the countersubject and remaining in D minor. Episode II follows, built upon the same material as Episode I, modulating from F major to D minor. The subject is then stated in its complete form in the alto in D minor—the first complete restatement after the exposition—immediately succeeded by Stretto I, in which the answer enters in the treble while the countersubject appears in the bass, effecting a modulation to A minor. A second codetta modulates from A minor back to D minor. Subsequently, an inverted answer appears in the alto in D minor, followed by Stretto II, which presents the subject by inversion in the bass in G minor, without countersubject. This leads into further fragmented statements: a subject fragment in the bass in G minor is immediately overlapped by Stretto III, which introduces the subject in the treble, also in G minor and without countersubject. The recapitulatory section features a fragmented subject in the alto in D minor, simultaneously accompanied by an inverted subject fragment in the bass, again without countersubject. This is followed by Stretto IV, in which the subject appears in the alto and treble in close succession—separated by half a bar—with the countersubject finally reappearing in the bass in D minor.
