This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in its original tonic key of F minor, preserving its thematic identity. It is followed by a connecting episode that undergoes slight alteration, specifically through the transposition of its opening material into the tonic key. The second subject subsequently appears, now also transposed to the tonic key of F minor, thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of a sonata-form recapitulation. The movement concludes with a coda that closely mirrors the coda from the exposition, both in content and structure, though transposed into the tonic key and slightly elongated.
