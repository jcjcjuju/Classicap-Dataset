This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with motivic material derived from the last five notes of the first subject. This is followed by a series of sequential statements of the second part of the second subject, transposed through the keys of C major, C minor, C♯ minor, and C♯ major. The harmonic trajectory culminates in a passage constructed upon the chord of the dominant minor ninth, which functions as a retransitional dominant preparation, ultimately resolving to the third entry of the first subject in the tonic key.
