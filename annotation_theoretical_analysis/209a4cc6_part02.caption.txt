This constitutes the second part of a ternary (da capo) structure. It opens with a statement of the first subject transposed to D flat major, which modulates to conclude in A flat major. This is followed by an episode spanning sixteen bars, characterized by sequential treatment derived from the rhythmic profile of the first subject. The episode is repeated, as indicated by a double bar and repeat sign directing a return to its beginning. The part concludes with a four-bar modulating passage that functions harmonically to reestablish the tonal context necessary for the subsequent return of the first subject in its original key.
