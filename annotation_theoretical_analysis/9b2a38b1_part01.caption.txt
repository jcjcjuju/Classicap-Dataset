This constitutes the Scherzo section in Simple Binary form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of A major and comprises two four-bar phrases: the first phrase concludes with a cadence in the dominant, while the second phrase returns to and closes in the tonic key. Following this, a development section ensues, which modulates through various harmonic areas and culminates in an episode in G sharp minor; this is succeeded by a passage built upon a sequence of dominant seventh chords that effects a return to the tonic key of A major. The first subject then reappears in its original form and key. The section concludes with a brief coda derived motivically from the first subject. The entire Scherzo is framed by repeat signs encompassing its full span.
