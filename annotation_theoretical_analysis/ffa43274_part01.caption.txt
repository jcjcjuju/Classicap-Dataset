This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form, presenting thematic material in the tonic and dominant keys. The first subject, in A major, is characterized by a soft and lyrical melody sustained over a tonic pedal for its initial duration. This is followed by a transition that abruptly shifts to a loud dynamic level with sforzandi, introducing harmonic instability through fleeting suggestions of F♯ minor before effecting a modulation to E major—the dominant key—by its conclusion. The second subject unfolds primarily in E major, featuring a melody articulated with dotted rhythms and mordents, distributed contrapuntally between the hands: the right hand predominantly soft, the left hand predominantly loud. Within this section, there are brief excursions into C♯ minor—signaled by the presence of B♯—and F♯ minor—marked by E♯. The latter portion of the second subject functions as a closing subject, reinforcing the dominant key area through extended cadential activity.
