This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage initiates in A flat major and comprises entirely new material except for a fleeting motivic reference to the exposition in its opening bar. It immediately modulates to B flat minor and proceeds through a compact harmonic trajectory that culminates in a half-cadence on G major—the dominant of C minor—thereby preparing the tonal return of the first subject in that key.
