This constitutes the exposition’s first subject in a sonata-form movement. The thematic material is presented in the tonic key of D major and unfolds through a series of phrase transformations. It opens with two balanced four-bar phrases, the second of which confirms the tonic through a cadence in D major. This is followed by a four-bar phrase that modulates to the dominant key of A major, though it returns to D major by its conclusion. The initial thematic idea—comprising the first two four-bar phrases—is then subjected to compression, reappearing as a single seven-bar phrase that retains the essential melodic and harmonic character of its earlier statement while achieving structural economy. The entire section remains grounded in the tonic key, with brief excursions to the dominant serving as part of the tonal articulation within the subject itself.
