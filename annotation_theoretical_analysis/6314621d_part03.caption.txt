This constitutes the recapitulatory section of a sonata-rondo form, beginning with the second subject transposed into the tonic key of G major. The thematic material of the second subject, originally presented in B flat major, is now restated in G major, thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of a recapitulation. Following this, the first subject returns in its original tonic key, though it is significantly varied and extended in its presentation, indicating developmental treatment within the recapitulatory framework. The movement concludes with a coda built upon a tonic pedal point, reinforcing the stability of the home key through sustained harmonic grounding.
