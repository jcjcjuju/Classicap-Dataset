This constitutes the recapitulation and coda of a sonata-form movement. The first subject returns in its original tonic key of G minor, reaffirming the home tonality with structural clarity. Following this restatement, a coda ensues that is thematically derived from the first subject, thereby reinforcing the primary thematic material while providing formal closure. The harmonic language remains rooted in G minor throughout this section, with no modulation occurring in either the recapitulated subject or the coda.
