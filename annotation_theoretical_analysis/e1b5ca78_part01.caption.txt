This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of A-flat major, structured as an eight-bar sentence concluding with a full close in the tonic, extended to nine bars by repetition of the final cadence. A connecting episode follows, functioning as a modulatory passage that leads to F minor and concludes on its dominant harmony. The arrival of the second subject is delayed by a four-bar transitional passage that initiates in D-flat major and descends through B-flat, G natural, and E-flat, culminating in a dominant seventh chord. Thereafter, the first subject and connecting episode reappear in their entirety. The second subject then commences in F major—a deviation from the conventional dominant key of E-flat major—though it ultimately concludes in E-flat major. A coda ensues, beginning and ending in the dominant key; while its tonal profile might suggest a continuation of the second subject due to the latter’s indefinite tonality, it is distinctly a coda constructed from tonic and dominant harmonies. The exposition concludes with a transitional passage that prepares the repeat of the entire exposition and subsequently leads into the development section.
