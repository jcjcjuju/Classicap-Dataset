This constitutes the coda of the movement, firmly rooted in G minor. The section commences with a surge of kinetic energy, articulated through a harmonic foundation of tonic (i), supertonic half-diminished seventh (ii∅⁷), and dominant seventh (V⁷) chords. The Neapolitan sixth chord reappears at two structural points, reinforcing its thematic and harmonic significance within the movement’s tonal architecture. Throughout, the harmonic language is intensified by the pervasive use of dominant and diminished seventh chords, alongside chromatic voice leading in the bass, though the passage remains tonally stable without modulation. An extended dominant–tonic cadential progression unfolds over several bars, consolidating the home key with emphatic finality. Motivic allusions to the first theme surface in fragmented form, recalling its characteristic contour and expressive inflection. The movement concludes with stark double-octave chromatic scales: initially deployed in contrary motion converging on the tonic pitch, then descending in parallel motion, before resolving into a final, unequivocal tonic sonority.
