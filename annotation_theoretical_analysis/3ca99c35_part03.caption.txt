This constitutes the recapitulatory section and coda of a sonata-form movement. The first subject returns in its original tonic key of E major, presented in a varied form. Within this restatement, a secondary melodic idea—first introduced in G sharp minor during the development section—is alluded to, now integrated into the thematic fabric of the recapitulation. Following this, the movement concludes with a coda built upon a tonic pedal point in E major; this closing section evokes the character and motivic content of the first subject without literal restatement, thereby providing structural closure through thematic suggestion and harmonic stability.
