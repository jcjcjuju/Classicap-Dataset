This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. It begins with an incomplete restatement of the first subject in the tonic key, presenting only a fragment of the original thematic material. This is followed by a newly composed bridge-passage that diverges significantly from the exposition’s transition, except in its final bar; this passage initiates with a repetition of the closing figure from the fragmented first subject, and its subsequent bars derive motivically from the concluding portion of the second subject. The second subject then returns transposed to the tonic key, slightly expanded in length compared to its initial presentation. The recapitulation concludes with a coda that reprises the original transition material, now adapted to the tonic key, and incorporates a modified version of this transition to facilitate the return of the codetta, which is also realigned to the tonic harmony.
