This constitutes the exposition of a ternary-form prelude. The first period begins in the tonic key of A minor and modulates to the dominant minor (E minor) before proceeding through a descending sequence that effects a modulation to the relative major, C major, concluding with a perfect cadence in that key. The second period is modulatory in function, traversing C major, G minor, and D minor, ultimately effecting a smooth harmonic return to the tonic key of A minor. The third period commences with a varied statement of the principal theme in the tonic, followed by a tonic pedal that underpins a coda, which reaffirms the tonic key with harmonic and registral emphasis.
