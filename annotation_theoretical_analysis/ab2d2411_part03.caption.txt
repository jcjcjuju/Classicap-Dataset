This constitutes the recapitulation and coda of a sonata-form movement. The first subject returns in its entirety in the tonic key of B flat major, reproducing the thematic material and internal repetitions originally presented in the exposition, including the initial eight-bar phrase ending on the dominant, its restatement an octave higher with slight alteration, and the subsequent developmental passage with its own varied repetition. Following this full restatement of the first subject, the movement proceeds to a coda that initiates with an enharmonic modulation from B flat major to B minor, effecting the transformation of B flat to A sharp. The coda concludes with a thematic allusion to the opening gesture of the first subject.
