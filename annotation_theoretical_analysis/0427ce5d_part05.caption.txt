This constitutes the coda of the movement. It begins with a triumphant restatement of the introductory theme in A flat major, articulated through tonic and dominant seventh harmonies. This is followed by a striking harmonic diversion: a succession of diminished seventh chords effects a modulation to E major, which functions enharmonically as the flattened sixth degree (♭VI) of the tonic key. This unexpected tonal shift initiates an extended cadential progression that reaffirms the structural pull toward the tonic. The final section of the coda returns to A flat major and incorporates thematic material from the episode, now distilled into a texture predominantly based on the tonic triad, culminating in a conclusive perfect cadence.
