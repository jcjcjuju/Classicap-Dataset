This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, preserving its essential thematic identity. It is followed by a varied and slightly lengthened bridge-passage that overlaps with the first subject; unlike its initial appearance in the exposition, the transition’s opening is now founded on the first subject but not a literal repetition, and its material is inverted and modified to ensure harmonic resolution within the tonic key. The second subject then appears in the tonic, presented in the original minor mode rather than the relative major as in the exposition, and is structured in two distinct sections. Within this tonic-key statement of the second subject, notable harmonic features include the Neapolitan sixth chord in A minor and an inverted chromatic supertonic ninth chord in the same key. The recapitulation concludes with a codetta derived from the movement’s opening codetta, now transposed into the tonic key, and the movement terminates without a coda.
