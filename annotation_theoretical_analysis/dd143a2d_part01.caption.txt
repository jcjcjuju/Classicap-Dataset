This constitutes the exposition and subsequent modulatory development of a real fugue in A minor. The exposition presents the subject in the alto voice in the tonic key of A minor, followed by a real answer in the treble at the dominant level of E minor; a brief codetta ensues before the subject reappears in the bass in A minor, answered by the tenor in E minor. The modulatory section commences with the subject in inversion introduced in the treble in G major, immediately imitated by the alto and tenor in the same key, then by the bass in D major. The texture becomes increasingly contrapuntally dense through extensive use of stretto, with the subject and its inversion appearing in overlapping entries across all voices. Episodes intervene to modulate between tonal areas: Episode I, unusually delayed in its first appearance, effects a modulation from A minor to C major and is constructed from the subject material; Episode II, derived from new material, modulates from D minor to F major. Throughout this section, the subject and answer appear both in their original and inverted forms, frequently in stretto combinations involving two or more voices, and in a variety of keys including C major, D minor, G major, F major, and A minor. Codettas punctuate several entries, and the harmonic trajectory culminates in a tonic pedal on A, over which the upper three voices engage in stretto based on the subject, ultimately resolving to a coda that confirms the tonic major (A major) with a final cadence.
