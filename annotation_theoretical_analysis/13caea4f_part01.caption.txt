This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject theme is presented entirely in the tonic key of D major, characterized by a recurring rhythmic pattern and concluding with a perfect cadence. Accented chords within this theme incorporate appoggiaturas—non-harmonic dissonances in the upper voice—that enhance its expressive quality. The second subject theme follows, initiating with a rhythmic figure analogous to that of the first theme but set above a semiquaver accompaniment. It is stated in F sharp minor, the mediant key, and terminates with an interrupted cadence.
