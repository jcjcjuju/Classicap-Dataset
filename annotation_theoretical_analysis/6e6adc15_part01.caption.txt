This constitutes the exposition of a binary-form prelude. The first period establishes a tonal trajectory from the tonic C-sharp major toward a conclusive cadence in the dominant minor, G-sharp minor. It is structured in three internal divisions: the initial phrase culminates on the dominant harmony; the second introduces Theme I in the tenor voice in the relative major (E major); and the third concludes with a perfect cadence in G-sharp minor. This period is imitative in texture, opening with the tenor entering one bar after the treble in canon-like fashion. A second theme emerges in the treble at the fifth bar and is immediately subjected to a descending sequential treatment over the next two bars. The second period remains predominantly in the tonic key and engages in developmental treatment of both themes. After its midpoint, however, Theme II is abandoned, and the musical discourse continues exclusively with motivic material derived from Theme I, now distributed between treble and bass in a freely imitative counterpoint. Throughout both periods, harmonic stasis is maintained around the central pitch C-sharp, with textural and contrapuntal variation serving as the primary means of musical interest rather than modulation.
