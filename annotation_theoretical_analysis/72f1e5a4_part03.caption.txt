This constitutes the recapitulatory section of a sonata-rondo form. It opens with the first subject in the tonic key of D major, presented with a tonic pedal point and incorporating a slightly elaborated version of the ornamental figure introduced earlier in the movement. This is followed by an episode that closely resembles the initial episode but is reharmonized to modulate to A major rather than E major, thereby fulfilling a tonally resolving function appropriate to recapitulation. The second subject then appears in the tonic key of D major, affirming the home key in contrast to its earlier statement in the dominant. A brief transitional passage follows, leading directly into the coda. The coda commences with a thematic allusion to the third subject and later shifts to a *Più Allegro* tempo, reinstating the rhythmic character associated with the first subject.
