This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, presenting its thematic material without transposition. Following this, the transition overlaps the conclusion of the first subject, commencing with the opening motive of that subject; this transitional passage is both shortened and altered in comparison to its initial appearance, omitting the E-flat major melody found in the exposition and inserting new material in D-flat major. The second subject then reappears, now transposed to the tonic key but rendered in the minor mode rather than the major, and is slightly lengthened and modified. The movement concludes with an overlapping coda based on the first subject, beginning with an inversion of the parts and featuring sequential imitation between the treble voices in its opening bars.
