This constitutes the first part of a simple binary form. The section opens with a first subject that unfolds simultaneously in A-flat and D-flat major, the latter being established as the tonic key; notably, the thematic material begins in the dominant key. This initial statement is followed by a varied reiteration of the same subject, which functions in lieu of a conventional repeat. A contrasting episode then ensues, providing structural and harmonic contrast. The part concludes with a varied and extended restatement of the first subject, returning to the original keys of A-flat and D-flat major. A double bar directs a repeat from the beginning of the episode, thereby enclosing the latter half of the binary structure within a repeat sign.
