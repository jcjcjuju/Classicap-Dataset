This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. It commences with a free fantasia characterized by dominant seventh arpeggios that unfold first in A flat major/minor, then proceed to G flat major, ultimately returning to D flat major. The second subject theme subsequently reappears in D flat major, initially resembling its earlier presentation but subsequently extended and modulating to B flat minor. Thereafter, the second subject theme is treated sequentially, gradually effecting a return to the tonic key of C sharp minor over a sustained dominant pedal.
