This constitutes the recapitulatory statement of the first subject within a large-scale fugal rondo design, followed by a coda. The original fugue subject returns in its initial form and tonic key of A-flat major, presented in octaves with a newly devised accompaniment. This is succeeded by a regular answer in the dominant, maintaining the contrapuntal integrity of the exposition. A final entry of the subject ensues, after which the concluding four-note motive undergoes developmental treatment, ultimately reaffirming the tonic key at the close of the section. The movement then proceeds to a coda that is principally constructed from material derived from the first subject, set above a sustained tonic pedal point.
