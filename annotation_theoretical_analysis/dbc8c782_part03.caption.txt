This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, largely unaltered except for specific contrapuntal and textural modifications: the motive is transferred to the bass with variation in both figure and accompaniment, a real sequence is employed between corresponding phrases, and the parts undergo inversion in the latter portion of the theme. The bridge-passage or transition follows, beginning in F major and modulating back to the tonic key of C major, thereby transposing the harmonic trajectory of the exposition’s transition—which originally moved from tonic to dominant—into a path that reaffirms the tonic. The second subject then appears transposed into the tonic key and is significantly expanded. Its first section presents the thematic material in the home key, while the second section incorporates an interpolated passage derived from the opening of the second subject itself. This interpolation features a shortened variation of the original descending sequence, immediately followed by a full restatement of the sequence with inverted parts and octave reinforcement in the bass, culminating in a full cadence in the tonic. The movement concludes without a coda, though two additional chords reinforce the final cadence. Throughout, the contrapuntal treatment of motives and the structural adaptation of sequential material underscore the movement’s integrative thematic logic.
