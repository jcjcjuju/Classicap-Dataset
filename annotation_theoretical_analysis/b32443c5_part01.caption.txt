This constitutes the initial formal section of the movement, presenting the primary thematic material and a subsequent episodic digression before returning to a varied restatement of the opening idea. It begins with a first subject firmly rooted in the tonic key of E♭ major, articulated through two balanced, four-bar phrases, each forming a complete sentence and subjected to immediate repetition. Following this thematic exposition, an episode ensues that, while beginning and concluding in the tonic key, effects a modulation to F minor in its central portion; specifically, the passage from the modulation through its immediate continuation is repeated with slight variation before resolving back to the tonic. The section then concludes with a varied reprise of the first subject, preserving its essential structure and tonal orientation in E♭ major while introducing ornamental or textural alterations.
