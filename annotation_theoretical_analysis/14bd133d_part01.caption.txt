This constitutes the exposition of a ternary-like prelude structure, comprising three distinct periods that outline a tonal trajectory from tonic to relative major and back to tonic. The first period establishes the tonic key of D major through a tonic pedal in its opening, culminating in a perfect cadence in the relative major, F major. The second period functions modulatorily, initiating a sequential process wherein its initial phrase modulates to G minor (the subdominant), followed by a subsequent phrase that moves to A minor (the dominant), ultimately resolving with a perfect cadence in the tonic major, D. The third period serves as a coda, beginning with an extended tonic pedal that reaffirms the home key, followed by a dominant pedal that reinforces tonal stability before the movement’s conclusion. Throughout, sequential imitation plays a significant role, particularly in the ascending sequence heard in the early phrases of the second period, which is later resumed after a brief interruption.
