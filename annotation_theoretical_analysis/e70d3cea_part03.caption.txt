This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in its original keys, maintaining the tonal trajectory from C sharp minor to E major as presented in the exposition. A connecting episode follows, distinct from its expositional counterpart; it initiates in E major and modulates to C sharp minor, thereby realigning the tonal structure toward the tonic. The second subject then appears transposed to begin in C sharp major—the tonic major—and concludes in C sharp minor, with its material significantly altered after the initial four bars. The movement concludes with a coda that incorporates a reference to the first subject in the upper part adjacent to the bass.
