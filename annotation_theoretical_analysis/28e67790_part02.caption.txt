This constitutes the second part of a binary-form movement, itself structured in simple binary form. It opens with a statement of the first subject transposed to D-flat major, functioning as the local tonic, and concludes with a cadence in A-flat major, the dominant. This phrase is followed by a varied repetition of identical length, preserving the thematic material while introducing ornamental or textural alterations. A brief developmental section ensues, derived motivically from the first subject, which modulates fluidly through related harmonies before leading into a restatement of the first subject. This restatement is presented in the original key of the movement but is harmonically adjusted to cadence conclusively in D-flat major, reaffirming the tonic of this section. The entire developmental passage and subsequent restatement (from the original bar 73 onward) are then repeated in full. The part concludes with a six-bar connecting passage that effects a modulation back to the global tonic key of F minor, preparing the eventual return of the first part.
