This constitutes the final thematic return and coda of a rondo-like structure. The section begins with a restatement of the first subject in the tonic key of G major, specifically presenting its initial eight-bar phrase with a newly devised accompanimental texture. This phrase is immediately followed by a substantially varied repetition of itself, maintaining the thematic identity while altering its surface details. The movement concludes with a coda that derives all of its material from the first subject, thereby reinforcing the tonic key and providing structural closure through thematic recall.
