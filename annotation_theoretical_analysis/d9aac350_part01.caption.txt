This constitutes the recapitulatory section of the prelude, functioning as a tonally resolved return of the opening material within the tonic key. It begins with a reproduction of the initial thematic statement, now firmly grounded in F sharp major, and incorporates slight ornamental elaboration of the opening gesture. The bass voice subsequently presents a free variation of a motivic figure originally introduced earlier in the movement, recontextualized within the tonic harmony. The period culminates in a perfect cadence in the tonic key, reaffirming structural closure through harmonic and thematic resolution.
