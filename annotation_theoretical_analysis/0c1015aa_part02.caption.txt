This constitutes the development section of the movement, incorporating a third subject. The section opens with a reference to the first subject, followed by transitional material that leads to the introduction of a third subject in F major, presented in a two-bar rhythmic pattern. Subsequently, the first two phrases of this third subject undergo developmental treatment, culminating in a dominant pedal point that persists for thirteen bars, functioning as a prolongational preparation for the return of the first subject.
