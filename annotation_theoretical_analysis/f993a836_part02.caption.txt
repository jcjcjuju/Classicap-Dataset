This constitutes a large-scale episode functioning as the central developmental section of the movement. It begins with a new thematic episode in A♭ major, which persists until its conclusion in that key. This is followed by transitional passages that predominantly feature a dominant pedal point, maintaining harmonic tension while alluding motivically to the preceding episode. The section resolves with a full cadence in the tonic key, coinciding precisely with the return of the first subject.
