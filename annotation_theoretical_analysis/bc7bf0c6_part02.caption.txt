This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section initiates in A minor and subsequently modulates to E minor, culminating in a resolution to G major. The harmonic trajectory traverses these tonal centers without direct reference to thematic material from the exposition, focusing instead on sequential or motivic elaboration implied by the modulatory design. The progression from the initial minor mode through a related minor key ultimately prepares the return to the tonic key at the onset of the recapitulation.
