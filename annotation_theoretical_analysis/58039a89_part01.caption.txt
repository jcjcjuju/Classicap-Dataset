This constitutes the exposition of a through-composed prelude structured in five distinct tonal periods, unified by the pervasive use of Theme I. The first period begins in the tonic key of F major, presenting Theme I and modulating through the dominant (C major) and G minor before returning to F major; it concludes with a perfect cadence in the dominant key, C major. The second period commences in C major, reintroducing Theme I transposed to the dominant, and subsequently touches upon D minor, C major, and F major, culminating in a half cadence in the relative minor, D minor. The third period initiates in D minor, again deploying Theme I in this key with a free adaptation of the opening material, and proceeds through a modulation that briefly halts in F major before arriving at a perfect cadence in C major. A brief transitional passage then modulates from C major to A minor, leading into the fourth period, which begins in A minor (the mediant minor), references D minor, and closes with a perfect cadence in A minor. The fifth and final period functions as a recapitulatory section: it begins in the tonic F major, reproducing the opening six bars of Theme I note for note, subsequently touches upon the subdominant major (B-flat major), and concludes with a perfect cadence firmly reestablishing the tonic key of F major. Throughout, Theme I is consistently deployed at the outset of each period, transposed to the prevailing tonal center, while thematic and harmonic coherence is maintained across the entire structure.
