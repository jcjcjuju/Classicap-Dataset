This constitutes the first variation of a theme-and-variations movement. The variation remains entirely in the tonic key of A flat major and spans the same structural duration as the original Air. It is defined by the pervasive presence of a demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) figuration, which permeates the texture throughout and serves as the primary means of variation, transforming the thematic material through rhythmic and textural elaboration while preserving the underlying harmonic and formal framework of the theme.
