This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section begins with material derived from the opening of the second subject, specifically a six-bar descending sequence initially presented in the exposition; here, it is restated with a slightly modified accompaniment. This passage modulates through several keys, briefly touching upon D major and B minor before proceeding through C major to A minor. In A minor, the sequence is repeated with inversion of the parts, and this repetition also makes reference to C major. A short dominant pedal on E follows, prepared by a German sixth chord, which functions as a retransitional device. The remainder of the development is based on the opening motive of the first subject, which is treated imitatively, alternating between treble and bass voices. This motivic treatment drives a harmonic progression that moves from E minor through D minor and ultimately arrives at C major—the tonic key. The section concludes with a clear statement of the first subject’s opening figure in the tonic, immediately followed by its octave transposition, thereby initiating the recapitulation.
