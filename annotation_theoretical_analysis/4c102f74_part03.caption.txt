This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of A major, retaining its essential thematic material with minor alterations in voicing and register. A transition follows, replicating the rhythmic and harmonic characteristics of its initial appearance, including the use of triplets and the chromatic inflection that previously facilitated modulation, though here it remains within the tonic orbit. The second subject begins with its original melodic contour but swiftly establishes the tonic key of A major by its third phrase, maintaining this tonal center thereafter except for brief excursions into A minor and F major. The closing theme appears in A major, incorporating chromatic inflections and frequently employing a tonic pedal in the bass, with its rhythmic profile derived from the second subject.
