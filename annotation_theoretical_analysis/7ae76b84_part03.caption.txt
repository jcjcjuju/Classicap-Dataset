This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key without alteration, preserving its original thematic and harmonic structure. The transition follows, now lengthened from twelve to fifteen bars; its initial portion is modified, while its concluding bars are transposed from the dominant key of the exposition into the tonic. The second subject reappears in the tonic key, largely unaltered except for its second section, which undergoes significant extension. This extended second section incorporates a descending modulating sequence that passes through C minor, B♭ major, and G minor. Within this passage, the harmony includes the Italian sixth chord on the flat submediant in B♭ major, followed by the first inversion of the chromatic supertonic seventh in the same key, which resolves to the second inversion of the tonic triad employed as a passing 6/4 chord. The first and third sections of the second subject remain otherwise intact, transposed to the tonic. The recapitulation concludes with a codetta that reproduces the original codetta from the exposition, now transposed into the tonic key.
