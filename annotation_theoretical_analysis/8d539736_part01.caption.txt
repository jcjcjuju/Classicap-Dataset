This constitutes the exposition of a binary or sectional prelude form, comprising two distinct periods. The first period establishes the tonic key through a tonic pedal in its opening, ultimately concluding with a perfect cadence in the dominant minor, F minor. The second period begins with a modulatory passage that sequentially touches upon E-flat minor, A-flat major, and D-flat major before reestablishing the tonic key by its midpoint. This period features a dominant pedal in its penultimate phase, followed by a final tonic pedal that reaffirms the home key. Throughout, the texture is shaped by the recurrence of an opening motivic figure in the treble, often deployed in contrary motion, and by descending sequential treatment of thematic material in both treble and bass voices.
