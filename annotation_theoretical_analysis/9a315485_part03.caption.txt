This constitutes a varied and extended restatement of the initial binary form, followed by a coda. The first subject returns in the tonic key of C minor, now elaborated and prolonged beyond its original scope, ultimately reaffirming the tonic through structural closure. The subsequent episode, derived motivically from the first subject, retains its rhythmic and thematic identity while undergoing variation. The return of the first subject in its original key is again modified, this time to ensure a conclusive cadence in C minor, thereby fulfilling the tonal and thematic requirements of a rounded binary design. This entire structure is then succeeded by a coda that provides finality through motivic fragmentation and harmonic stabilization in the tonic.
