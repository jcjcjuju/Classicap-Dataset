This constitutes Episode II, functioning as a digression in the relative minor (G minor) within the broader sonata-rondo framework. The episode is structured in binary form, comprising two distinct sections, each marked with a double bar and repeat. The first section concludes with a half cadence, preceded by a German sixth chord that intensifies harmonic tension before the cadential arrival. The second section begins with an inversion of contrapuntal parts and presents a modified reproduction of the second phrase from the first section; this alteration enables the phrase to conclude with a full cadence rather than a half cadence, thereby achieving tonal closure in G minor. A brief modulatory link follows the binary episode, effecting a transition from G minor to B flat major—the tonic key—and preparing the return of the principal subject.
