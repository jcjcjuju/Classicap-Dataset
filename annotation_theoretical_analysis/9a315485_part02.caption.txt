This constitutes the second part of a binary or ternary design, functioning as a contrasting middle section. It commences with a thematic subject that begins in A-flat major and modulates to conclude in E-flat major, thereby establishing a new tonal area distinct from the tonic C minor of the first part. This subject is followed by an episode that is entirely constructed upon the chord of the dominant ninth; the rhythmic profile of this episode remains consistent with that of the preceding subject. The entire section is framed by repeat signs, indicating that the material from the second phrase onward is to be repeated, reinforcing its structural and harmonic identity as a self-contained unit within the movement’s larger formal architecture.
