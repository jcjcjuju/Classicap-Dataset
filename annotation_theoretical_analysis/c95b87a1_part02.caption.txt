This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with thematic material derived from the episode of the exposition, which undergoes developmental treatment and plays a central role in the contrapuntal and harmonic activity between Bars 81–95. A new thematic subject is introduced, characterized by distinct motivic content, and is subsequently restated in B flat minor, thereby engaging in a chromatic shift that intensifies the tonal instability typical of development sections. The latter portion of this section features a transitional passage that systematically reestablishes harmonic directionality, culminating in a modulation back to the tonic key of B flat major, thus preparing for the structural return of the first subject in the recapitulation. Throughout, the texture and harmonic language reflect developmental procedures, including fragmentation, sequential treatment, and enharmonic reinterpretation, all contributing to the section’s functional role in destabilizing and reconfiguring thematic material before the return to tonic stability.
