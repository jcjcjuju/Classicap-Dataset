This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key as an eight-bar sentence concluding with a perfect cadence, subsequently prolonged by four additional bars sustained over a tonic pedal. A bridge-passage follows, comprising scale passages that initiate a free melodic sequence. The second subject appears in the dominant key (F major) and consists of a single thematic section extensively extended through sectional and cadential repetitions; within this section, a short sequence occurs in which the voices are inverted alternately from bar to bar. The exposition concludes with a codetta that briefly alludes to the subdominant key (B-flat major) before resolving onto a brief tonic pedal in F major. The entire exposition is marked for literal repetition.
