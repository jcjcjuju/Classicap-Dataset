This constitutes a distinct thematic section in A flat major, structured as two four-bar phrases, each subjected to immediate repetition. The initial phrase establishes the new tonal center of A flat major and concludes with a cadence in E flat major, the dominant key. The subsequent phrase, while maintaining the same durational and formal proportions, continues the harmonic trajectory initiated by its predecessor, thereby reinforcing the structural symmetry and tonal design characteristic of this section.
