This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in a varied statement in the tonic key of E flat major, with its final two bars omitted. A connecting episode follows, reworked from its initial appearance in the exposition so as to modulate not to the dominant but instead to reaffirm the tonic key. The second subject then appears transposed from its original dominant key (B flat major) to the tonic key of E flat major, thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of sonata-form recapitulation. The movement concludes with a coda that extends from the end of the second subject to the final cadence.
