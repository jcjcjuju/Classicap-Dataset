This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, though only its initial eight-bar sentence is presented, omitting the varied repetition heard in the exposition. The transition that follows is substantially recomposed and extended; it initially suggests a continuation of the first subject but diverges at its third bar, introducing a new contrapuntal texture wherein the bass imitates the treble at the interval of a twelfth below with a one-bar delay. This is succeeded by an inversion of the preceding passage, which overlaps with its original, and culminates in a curtailed version of its final figure. This abbreviated motive then serves as the basis for a sequential passage characterized by overlapping imitative entries, ascending through a series of modulations from G major via A minor and B minor to the tonic key of D major. The second subject follows in the tonic, but with its internal order altered: the second section appears first, modified and expanded, before the first section of the second subject is restated, also transposed to the tonic. The recapitulation concludes with a slightly altered codetta, now firmly in the tonic key.
