This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in E flat major (the tonic key), commencing on the third inversion of the chord of the eleventh. The initial phrase spans eight bars and is subsequently restated in a different register. A later phrase, originally four bars in length, undergoes a varied repetition. The first subject concludes with a brief codetta. Without pause, a connecting episode ensues, directly derived from the first subject; within this episode, the third inversion of the chord of the eleventh reappears, now altered to include a minor ninth rather than the major ninth heard previously. This transitional passage modulates to and cadences on F, the dominant of the upcoming second subject key. The second subject then unfolds in B flat major, comprising an eight-bar thematic statement followed by a four-bar connecting passage and a varied repetition of the original thematic material. A coda follows, constructed from new material and remaining within the dominant key (B flat major); it features simple arpeggiations of the B flat triad, succeeded by arpeggios of the dominant chord of B flat, the latter accompanied by a trill on the fifth of the chord. Motivic material from the first subject reappears within the coda, and the section concludes with a short connecting passage derived from the coda’s final phrase, leading to the double bar and repeat.
