This constitutes the exposition of a ternary-like prelude form, comprising three distinct periods that articulate a tonal trajectory from tonic stability through modulation and return. The first period establishes the tonic key with a tonic pedal in its opening, culminating in a perfect cadence in the dominant. The second period initiates a modulation toward F♯ minor before reestablishing E major, concluding with a perfect cadence in the tonic that functions as a dominant preparation for A major—the implied key of the subsequent section. The third period begins by transposing the opening material to the subdominant, supported by a subdominant pedal, then transitions back to the original tonic key; it features a dominant pedal in its middle phase and a treble tonic pedal near its close, ultimately resolving with a plagal cadence. Throughout, the foundational motivic figure introduced at the outset governs the thematic content, and each period contains internal subdivisions that articulate smaller phrase groupings.
