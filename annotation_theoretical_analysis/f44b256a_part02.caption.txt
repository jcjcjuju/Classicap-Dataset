This constitutes a contrasting middle section featuring a third subject in A-flat major. The third subject is initially presented and subsequently undergoes variation. Following this varied statement, a four-bar imitative passage intervenes before the subject reappears in a second varied form. The section concludes with an extended passage built upon a dominant pedal point, which serves a retransitional function by preparing for the return of the first subject. This pedal point passage begins immediately after the second variation of the third subject, which itself cadences on the dominant of A-flat major.
