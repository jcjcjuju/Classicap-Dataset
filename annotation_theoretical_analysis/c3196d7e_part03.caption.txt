This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, though only its initial eight bars are presented. The subsequent bridge-passage or transition is significantly lengthened compared to its appearance in the exposition. It begins with the opening motive of the first subject now assigned to the bass rather than the treble, and incorporates an interpolated freely modulating sequential passage derived from the second four-quaver figure of that motive. This sequential passage traverses a series of keys—F major, D flat major, B flat minor, F minor, D flat major, B flat minor, A flat major, and finally F minor—in which it concludes with a half cadence. Midway through the transition, the four-quaver figure shifts from the bass to the treble, and shortly thereafter reverts to the opening four-quaver configuration of the original motive; from this point onward, the passage proceeds as an exact transposition into F minor of the corresponding segment from the original transition. The second subject then appears in the tonic key, with its second section substantially modified and extended. An early alteration involves the opening sentence achieving a full close after eight bars, followed by a notable contrapuntal passage in which the opening material of the first subject is combined simultaneously with the thematic content of the second section of the second subject, the latter functioning as a counter-subject. The recapitulation concludes with a codetta that transposes the original codetta into the tonic key.
