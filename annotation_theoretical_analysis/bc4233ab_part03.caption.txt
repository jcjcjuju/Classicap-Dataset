This constitutes a literal restatement of the Menuetto section, presenting the first subject in E♭ major concluding with a half cadence on the dominant, followed by the second subject, which is derived motivically from the first and remains in the tonic key of E♭ major. The section concludes with a coda featuring a prolonged plagal cadence in which the subdominant harmony assumes structural significance, reinforcing the tonic through an extended IV–I progression.
