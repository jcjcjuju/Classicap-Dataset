This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata-rondo form, exhibiting an irregular ordering in which the second subject returns prior to the principle subject. The recapitulated second subject appears in the tonic key and is divided into two sections, both of which are somewhat lengthened compared to their initial presentation. The second section undergoes significant modification near its close; rather than concluding with a second perfect cadence in the tonic, its repetition merges midway into a link-like passage derived from motivic material of the principle subject, thereby directly introducing the subsequent recapitulation of that subject. The principle subject then reappears in the tonic for a third, incomplete entry: its first section is considerably extended through augmentation applied at the end of each phrase within a passage marked *a piacere*, which draws upon figures from the opening of the principle subject. This extension, combined with frequent pauses and ad libitum tempo fluctuations, imparts a recitative-like character to the passage. Harmonically, this section features a transient modulation to the subdominant minor and includes a chromatic supertonic triad along with associated dissonances. Following this, a modified version of the initial portion of the episode is interpolated, now adjusted to conclude with a perfect cadence in the tonic. The movement concludes with a coda based on material from the second subject, which incorporates a Neapolitan sixth chord in the tonic key.
