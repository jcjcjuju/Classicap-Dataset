This constitutes the first period of a prelude structured in four distinct tonal sections, functioning as an extended introductory statement that establishes the thematic and harmonic framework of the movement. The period opens with Theme I, a four-bar phrase characterized by a bass line descending through the notes of its common chords, with ornamental embellishments inserted between principal chord tones; the upper three voices present homophonic block chords, occasionally enriched by passing notes for textural vitality. In the third bar of this theme, the harmonic structure is articulated through a second inversion (root + fourth + sixth) of the prevailing harmony. This thematic block is followed immediately by Theme II (a two-bar unit), whose lower voice proves highly generative throughout the movement, though its upper component is not subsequently reused in full. Theme III appears as a single-bar idea, succeeded by Theme IV, which emerges in the upper voice and features a four-note incipit that is promptly displaced by a closely related figuration in the following bar—this latter figure dominates subsequent appearances, although Theme IV returns in its complete form within an ascending sequence later in the movement. The entire period culminates in a perfect cadence in the dominant key, E-flat major, thereby establishing a tonal goal that reflects a departure from the tonic while maintaining structural coherence through the systematic transposition of the opening thematic material.
