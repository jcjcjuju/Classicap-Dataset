This constitutes a recapitulatory section followed by a coda. The initial segment restates the first subject, now transposed to begin in A flat major rather than A flat minor, and undergoes the same sequence of modulations as in its initial presentation: from the tonic key to C flat major (the relative major of A flat minor, though now functioning within the context of A flat major), then to B minor, D major, and E flat major, before returning to the tonic key of A flat major at its conclusion. The subsequent coda is sustained entirely over a pedal point and features double counterpoint between Bars 70–73: the voice adjacent to the bass in Bars 70–71 is transposed to the treble register in Bars 72–73, while the original treble line of Bars 70–71 is correspondingly relocated to the voice adjacent to the bass in Bars 72–73.
