This constitutes the first of two large-scale periods in a binary-form prelude. The section begins in the tonic minor key of A minor and initiates a series of modulatory excursions, first progressing to the dominant minor (E minor), then briefly returning to the tonic, followed by a shift to the relative major (C major), the subtonic major (G major), and the subdominant minor (D minor). After this sequence of tonal references, the music returns to the tonic key before concluding with a half cadence on the dominant major (E major). Throughout this period, the texture is governed by two distinct thematic figures introduced at the outset: Theme I in the bass and Theme II in the treble. These themes are consistently presented in double counterpoint, alternating registers at the distance of one bar, and are typically paired together except in designated episodic passages derived motivically from the third bar of the movement. Imitative procedures pervade the entire section, with thematic material subjected to continuous contrapuntal manipulation, and the harmonic trajectory is shaped by brief tonicizations rather than extended modulations, creating a fluid and highly integrated tonal landscape.
