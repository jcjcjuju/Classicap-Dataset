This constitutes the opening thematic section of the movement, functioning as a self-contained thematic area in A flat major. It begins with an introductory theme that establishes the tonic through repeated second-inversion tonic chords, interspersed with passing diminished seventh chords (B–D–F–A♭), and concludes with a perfect cadence. The subsequent passage alternates between tonic and dominant seventh harmonies, featuring descending chromatic movement in the bass and enriched by suspensions and appoggiaturas in the upper voice. A sequential modulation follows, progressing from A flat major through B flat minor and C minor before arriving in C major, where the tonic triad is ornamented by appoggiaturas resolving stepwise into chord tones, accompanied by a cross-rhythm in the melody. The section concludes with an expanded restatement of the introductory theme: after an initial literal reprise, a rising sequential passage briefly modulates through B flat minor, D flat major, and E flat major; the opening motive then returns an octave higher, and the original cadential figure is reinforced in the bass in double octaves before resolving onto the tonic triad.
