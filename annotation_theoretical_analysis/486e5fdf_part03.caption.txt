This constitutes the second variation of a theme-and-variations movement. The variation remains in the tonic key of A flat major throughout. The principal thematic material—the “Air”—is presented in a transformed state, with its melodic content now assigned to the bass register. This inversion of textural hierarchy retains the structural and harmonic identity of the original theme while altering its timbral and contrapuntal presentation. The variation spans the full thirty-five-bar span of the original theme, preserving its sectional architecture without modulation or formal alteration.
