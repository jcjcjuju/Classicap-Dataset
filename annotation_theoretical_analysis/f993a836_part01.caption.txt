This constitutes the exposition of a sonata-rondo form. It opens with the first subject in the tonic key of C major, which concludes with a cadence in the tonic. This thematic material is then immediately restated, now transposed to end in the dominant key. Following this, an episode begins with a three-bar phrase that modulates to D minor; this phrase is repeated a whole tone lower and subsequently leads through further harmonic motion to a modulation into the dominant key, where it concludes with a cadence. A cadenza then effects a return to the tonic key. The exposition closes with a varied restatement of the first subject, presented in the original tonic key, with its harmonic structure preserved despite surface-level variation.
