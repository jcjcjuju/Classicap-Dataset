This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of B flat major but is considerably altered: its opening is accompanied by a rhythmic figure previously associated with the commencement of the second subject, and the harmonic realization diverges from the exposition, continuing through a reharmonized continuation up to a structural pause. Rather than concluding in the tonic as in the exposition, the latter portion of the first subject is elongated and terminates in G flat major. The connecting episode that follows employs substantially the same thematic material as its expositional counterpart, though transposed through various keys; it originates in G flat major and ultimately modulates back to the tonic key of B flat major. The second subject then reappears, now transposed entirely into the tonic key, both beginning and ending in B flat major. The movement concludes with a coda that initially mirrors the expositional coda in structure but is transposed to remain within the tonic key. This material is subsequently extended and developed, incorporating a reference to the opening of the original coda, followed by a scale passage that introduces new thematic content. The coda ultimately closes with reminiscences of the first subject.
