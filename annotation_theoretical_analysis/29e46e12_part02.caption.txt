This constitutes a self-contained thematic section in D♭ major, functioning as a contrasting middle part within the movement’s large-scale ternary design. It is built upon an eight-bar thematic phrase that establishes the tonic key of D♭ major. This phrase is immediately repeated with slight alterations and concludes with a modulation to G♭ major, where the same thematic material reappears. The G♭ major statement is subsequently repeated with minor modifications and cadences in E♭ minor. A three-bar transitional passage then modulates back to the tonic key of D♭ major, after which the initial thematic phrase returns, followed by an immediate restatement of the same phrase an octave lower. The section concludes with a four-bar passage that prepares the return of the first part of the movement.
