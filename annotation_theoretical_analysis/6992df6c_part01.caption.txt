This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in A flat major, the tonic key, and is structured in two distinct parts: the initial four-bar phrase concludes on a dominant seventh harmony, while the subsequent eight-bar melody achieves a full cadential closure in the tonic. A connecting episode follows, commencing with a brilliant arpeggiated passage firmly rooted in the tonic key and proceeding through a modulation to the dominant key, E flat major; this episode incorporates a contrasting thematic idea beginning midway through and ultimately cadences in the dominant. The second subject then unfolds in E flat major, spanning six bars and characterized by a distinct melodic profile; its bass line features immediate repetition in the first two bars, with a slight alteration in the third iteration, and the entire subject remains harmonically grounded in the dominant key from start to finish. The exposition concludes with a coda introducing a new motivic figure, which is immediately restated in a slightly varied form.
