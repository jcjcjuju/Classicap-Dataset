This constitutes the exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in C minor. The enunciation section opens with the subject presented in the alto in the tonic key of C minor, followed by a tonal answer in the treble in the dominant key of G minor, accompanied by a countersubject in the alto. A codetta ensues, derived from the first limb of the subject in the treble and the initial notes of the countersubject in contrary motion in the alto, both engaged in an ascending sequence that modulates from G minor back to C minor. The exposition concludes with a restatement of the subject in the bass in C minor, now paired with the countersubject in the treble. The modulatory section comprises four episodes interspersed with further entries of the subject or answer. Episode I modulates from C minor to E♭ major and is constructed from motivic material derived from the subject and countersubject; this is followed by a subject entry in the treble in E♭ major with the countersubject in the bass. Episode II briefly modulates back to C minor, leading to an answer in the alto in G minor with the countersubject in the treble. Episode III then modulates from G minor to C minor, after which the subject reappears in the treble in C minor with the countersubject in the alto. Episode IV effects a modulation from C minor to E♭ major and back to C minor. The recapitulatory section begins with the subject in the bass in C minor, while the countersubject is distributed between the treble and alto. The movement concludes with a tonic pedal and coda in C minor, during which the subject appears in the treble without the countersubject, the inner voices proceeding independently, and the final chord is altered to major, producing a Tierce de Picardie.
