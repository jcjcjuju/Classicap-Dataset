This constitutes the episode of a ternary or rondo-like form. The section begins with a sentence structure comprising two phrases of four and six bars respectively: the first phrase establishes F sharp minor and concludes with a half-cadence articulated by an augmented sixth chord resolving to the dominant harmony; the second phrase, initially restating the opening material, modulates in its second bar to D major, where it achieves a full cadence, reiterated cadentially twice. This is followed by a modulating sequential passage that originates in D major and transiently traverses E minor before arriving at a half-cadence in F sharp minor, succeeded by a brief link. The episode then presents a modified restatement of its initial sentence, now transposed and adjusted to conclude with a full cadence in F sharp major. A final link, derived from earlier scalar figuration, effects a modulation through D minor to A major, thereby preparing the return of the principal theme.
