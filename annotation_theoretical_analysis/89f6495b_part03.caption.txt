This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section commences with a reference to the opening of the first subject, drawing upon its initial motivic content, and proceeds to treat this material—alongside the “Le-be-wohl” phrase—as the primary thematic substance of the entire development. The “Le-be-wohl” motive, foundational to the movement’s thematic architecture, undergoes extensive manipulation and recontextualization throughout this section, serving as the core element for contrapuntal and harmonic exploration.
