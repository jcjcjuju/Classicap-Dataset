This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, presented without alteration. It is followed by a bridge-passage that is both modified and shortened through the omission of a portion of the original transitional material. The second subject, now transposed to conform with the tonic key, begins in D minor—a key that functions analogously to the relationship between A minor and G major in the exposition—and ultimately concludes in C major. The first section of this second subject is significantly expanded. Its initial phrase opens with reversed metric accents relative to its exposition counterpart; however, the insertion of an additional half-bar realigns the accents by the phrase’s conclusion. This interpolated half-bar inversely affects the immediately subsequent repetition of the phrase, which now begins with the original accentuation and ends with reversed accents. This metrical displacement consequently propagates into the following phrase, which also appears with reversed accents. An added passage within this section derives motivically from the segment of the original transition that was omitted in the recapitulated bridge, culminating in an exact restatement of part of that transitional material. The second section of the second subject is slightly extended at its close to reinforce the final cadence in the tonic key.
