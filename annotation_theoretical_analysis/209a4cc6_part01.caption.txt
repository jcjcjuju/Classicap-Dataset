This constitutes the first part (A) of a simple binary form. The section opens with a first subject that initiates in E-flat major—the dominant of the tonic key, A-flat major—and concludes firmly in the tonic. The initial phrase of this subject undergoes a varied repetition, followed by a continuation that completes the thematic statement. A double bar signals the transition to an episode, which commences with an eight-bar sequential passage derived from the first subject. The first subject then returns in varied form, initially presented in the bass with a running quaver accompaniment in the treble; subsequently, the subject shifts to the treble while the quaver accompaniment moves to the bass. The part concludes with a coda, after which a repeat instruction directs a return to the beginning of the episode.
