This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of G major, presented in a curtailed version that omits the modulations to F major and C major found in its initial appearance. A shortened connecting episode follows, significantly abridged and reharmonized to conclude on the dominant of F major rather than the dominant of B major as in the exposition. The second subject then appears not in the tonic key as conventional sonata practice would dictate, but begins in E major for its initial eight-bar phrase, which is subsequently restated in E minor; this material then modulates to G major, where the same thematic content recurs. The passage from this point through the end of the second subject represents a harmonic reworking of the corresponding material from the exposition. The section concludes with an extended coda.
