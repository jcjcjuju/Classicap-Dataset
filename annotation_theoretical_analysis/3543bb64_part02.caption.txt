This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section commences with two introductory bars, followed by an extended episode in A-flat major. This episode gives way to the core developmental activity, designated as the “working out,” which unfolds through motivic and harmonic elaboration. The entire development section is characterized by its departure from the tonic and dominant keys of the exposition, exploring remote tonal areas—most notably A-flat major—and engaging in structural and textural transformation of thematic material previously presented.
