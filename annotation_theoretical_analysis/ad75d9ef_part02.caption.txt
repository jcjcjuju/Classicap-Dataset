This constitutes the development section of a sonata form, realized entirely as an episode. Although it does not develop thematic material from the exposition in the conventional sense, its opening motive—featuring a semiquaver accompaniment—derives from material presented earlier. The texture is characterized by frequent invertible counterpoint and sequential treatment of motives. The harmonic trajectory begins in A minor and proceeds through a series of modulations: E minor, B minor, F♯ minor, E minor again, D minor, and G minor, ultimately arriving at D major. The section concludes on the dominant chord of D major. Notable harmonic events include: a chord initially interpreted as the first inversion of the submediant in B minor (at the second chord of a measure) that functions enharmonically as a Neapolitan sixth in F♯ minor; a chord similarly reinterpreted from G minor to D major; and the first inversion of the minor seventh chord in G minor appearing as the fourth chord of a measure. The final two measures function as a transitional link preparing the return of the tonic key in the recapitulation.
