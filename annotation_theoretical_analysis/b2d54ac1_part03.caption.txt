This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key but is significantly modified: its initial phrase is presented in the tonic, then immediately restated in A minor, thereby forming a modulating sequence across the first eight bars. The subsequent after-phrase appears in C major and diverges from its exposition counterpart. In contrast to the exposition—where only the second phrase of the subject was repeated—the recapitulation features two statements of the first phrase and a single statement of the second. This is followed by an unaltered bridge-passage that retains its original harmonic and motivic content. The second subject then appears transposed to the tonic key, divided into two distinct subsections: the first spans a twenty-bar span and the second a ten-bar span, both adhering to the structural and thematic proportions established in the exposition while conforming to the tonal requirements of the recapitulation.
