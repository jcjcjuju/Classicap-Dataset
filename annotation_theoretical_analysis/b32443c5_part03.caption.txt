This constitutes the final structural section of the movement, comprising a varied restatement of the first subject followed by a coda. The first subject, originally presented in E flat major, returns in a modified guise, retaining its essential thematic identity while incorporating variation in its realization. This varied statement fulfills a recapitulatory function, reasserting the tonic key and primary thematic material. It is succeeded by a coda, which serves to conclude the movement, providing formal closure through thematic or harmonic means derived from preceding material.
