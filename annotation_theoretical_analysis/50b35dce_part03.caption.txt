This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of G minor, preserving its original thematic material. The subsequent connecting episode closely mirrors its exposition counterpart but is modified to modulate to the dominant key rather than to F major, thereby maintaining tonal coherence within the recapitulatory framework. The second subject then appears transposed to the tonic key of G minor; its latter portion is subjected to variation and extension compared to its initial presentation. The movement concludes with a coda derived from the opening material of the second subject, as heard in the exposition, though now significantly extended. The final eight bars unfold over a pedal point, culminating in a Picardy third—a major triad on the tonic.
