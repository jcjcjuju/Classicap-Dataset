This constitutes the exposition of a ternary or binary formal design, articulated in two distinct periods. The first period establishes a thematic complex in the tonic key through the simultaneous presentation of three contrapuntal subjects—Theme I in the treble, Theme II in the bass, and Theme III in the middle voice—thereby initiating a texture governed by the principles of triple counterpoint. This period concludes with a perfect cadence in the relative minor, F♯ minor, thereby effecting a tonal departure from the tonic. The second period begins with modulatory activity, drawing primarily on thematic material derived from Theme III; scalar passagework is deployed beneath this subject as a means of harmonic propulsion. The modulation traverses the keys of B major and E major before ultimately reaffirming the tonic key. At this point, all three themes reappear in their original contrapuntal configuration, now restated in the tonic, thereby reinforcing structural coherence through thematic return and tonal resolution.
