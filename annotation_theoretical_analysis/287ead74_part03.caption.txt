This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns initially in C minor—the dominant minor—before reappearing in a contracted form of six bars (reduced from the original eight) in the tonic key of F minor. Following this, the second subject is presented in the tonic key, now cast in the minor mode rather than the relative major heard in the exposition; this modal transformation, a characteristic expressive device in Mozart’s practice, imparts a heightened emotional quality to the thematic material. The second subject is also slightly lengthened and undergoes modification in its restatement. The recapitulation concludes with a codetta firmly grounded in the tonic key, derived motivically from earlier material in the movement.
