This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of E minor and is divisible into two distinct parts, each beginning and concluding in the tonic. The first part establishes the tonic through a self-contained thematic statement, while the second part unfolds over a dominant pedal point, reinforcing tonal stability through harmonic suspension. This second part is subsequently restated with minor elaborations, preserving its foundational structure while introducing subtle textural or ornamental variation.  

Following the first subject, a connecting episode initiates with a four-bar phrase presented in octaves within the tonic key; this material is then imitated and harmonized, generating contrapuntal momentum that transitions toward a pedal point on the dominant of B minor. This dominant pedal evokes the harmonic character of the second part of the first subject, functioning as a preparatory gesture for the second subject’s entrance.  

The second subject appears in B minor, the dominant minor, and initially exhibits sequential construction over six bars. It then modulates to C major, where it remains until a retransition is effected via a diminished seventh chord rooted on E♯ (enharmonically equivalent to F♮), which facilitates a return to B minor. The key of B minor is then firmly reestablished over four bars, which are subsequently treated in double counterpoint, demonstrating invertible counterpoint at the octave or tenth. The second subject concludes definitively in B minor, completing the tonal and thematic duality characteristic of the sonata exposition.
