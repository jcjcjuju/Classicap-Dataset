This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject reappears in a shortened and varied form, transposed to the tonic minor key, presenting only a fragment of its original thematic material. This is followed by a modified connecting episode: its initial portion is altered, while the remainder corresponds closely to the latter part of the exposition’s connecting episode, now transposed into the tonic key and slightly varied. The second subject then returns in the tonic major key (A major), maintaining its essential structure but featuring a slight alteration near its conclusion, likely due to the limited keyboard compass available in Beethoven’s time. The movement concludes with an extended coda, which includes a reference to the second subject in inversion.
