This constitutes the exposition and subsequent modulatory episodes of a tonal fugue in A major. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the treble in the tonic key of A major, immediately followed by a tonal answer in the alto transposed to the dominant key of E major; this answer enters before the subject’s completion, an unusual feature for fugal expositions. The subject then recurs in the bass in A major, followed directly by an answer in the same bass voice in E major. A codetta closes the exposition firmly in A major, after which the subject reappears in the treble once more in the tonic. The modulatory section commences with Episode I, which modulates from A major to F♯ minor and concludes in that key. The subject is then stated in the bass in F♯ minor, followed after a brief gap by another subject statement in the bass now in E major. Episode II ensues, modulating from A major to E major, closing in the dominant before returning to A major. A new subject statement in the bass in A major is accompanied by a newly introduced, more rapid countersubject-like passage in the alto. This is followed by an answer in the alto in A major, then another answer in the same voice transposed to E major. Episode III modulates from E major through A major to D major, where the subject appears in the alto and the episode closes in D major. A chromatically altered subject is then presented in the bass in B minor, leading into Episode IV, which modulates from B minor to F♯ minor. An altered answer follows in the bass, closing in F♯ minor. After a brief gap, the subject returns in the alto in A major, succeeded by an altered answer in the bass in E major. The section concludes with a coda featuring frequent imitative entries of the subject.
