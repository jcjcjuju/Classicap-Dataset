This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of F sharp minor, presented throughout in a considerably varied guise. A connecting episode follows, initiating in D major and bearing resemblance to its counterpart in the exposition, yet substantially altered in its harmonic trajectory so as to conclude in F sharp major—the tonic major—thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of recapitulatory function. The second subject then appears transposed into this tonic major key and is also subjected to variation. The movement concludes with a coda that initially mirrors the exposition’s closing material, now transposed from D major to F sharp major, and subsequently incorporates thematic references to both the first and second subjects. The coda features a progressive sharpening of the key signature—from one sharp to two, and finally to three sharps—after which the music is entirely based on the first subject in the tonic key, culminating in a Tierce de Picardie with a major tonic chord.
