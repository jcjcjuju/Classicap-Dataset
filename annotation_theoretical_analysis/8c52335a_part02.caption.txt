This constitutes a distinct formal section functioning as a contrasting middle episode within the movement’s overarching structure. It begins with the introduction of a third subject in C major, articulated through an eight-bar sentence that concludes with a full cadence in that key; this thematic statement is immediately repeated in its entirety. Following the repetition, a transitional passage unfolds in a four-bar periodic rhythm, predominantly sustained over a dominant pedal point of C major, which ultimately modulates to G major. This transition culminates in a brief codetta formed by the repetition of its final two bars. The section continues with a fourteen-bar phrase derived from the first subject, now recontextualized to terminate on the dominant of G major, thereby preparing for the subsequent return of the first subject in the tonic key.
