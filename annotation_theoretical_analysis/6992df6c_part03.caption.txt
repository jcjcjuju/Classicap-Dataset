This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of A flat major, though it is considerably varied and elongated in its presentation. It is accompanied by a passage resembling the opening of the connecting episode from the exposition. The second part of the first subject diverges tonally from its original statement, appearing in D flat major rather than the tonic. This is followed by an enharmonic modulation—effecting respellings of A flat as G sharp and D flat as C sharp—that leads to the key of E major. The connecting episode then commences in E major, constructed entirely from the same motivic material as its counterpart in the exposition, now transposed to modulate back to the tonic key of A flat major. The second subject follows in the tonic key, appearing with minimal alteration beyond harmonic adaptation to A flat major. The movement concludes with a coda that initially recalls the coda of the exposition; after an intervening four-bar passage of contrasting character, it again references material from the connecting episode and ultimately closes over a tonic pedal point.
