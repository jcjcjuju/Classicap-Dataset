This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in its original tonic key of D major, preserving its essential thematic identity. It is followed by a connecting episode that, while initially resembling its expository counterpart, is significantly altered in its harmonic trajectory, ultimately cadencing in E minor rather than preparing the dominant of the relative minor as in the exposition. The second subject then reappears, now transposed and modified to conform to the tonal requirements of the recapitulation: it commences in E minor—the mediant minor—and undergoes its characteristic modulatory process before concluding firmly in the tonic key of D major. A final coda ensues, presenting material derived from the earlier coda but adjusted harmonically and texturally to secure a conclusive cadence in D major, thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution expected in the recapitulatory phase.
