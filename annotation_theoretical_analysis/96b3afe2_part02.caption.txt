This constitutes an episode functioning as a developmental interlude. It is founded upon a new subject presented in the bass, which is a diminution of the original fugue subject. This diminished subject is treated in an almost canonical texture and is simultaneously combined with an augmented statement of the original subject. This contrapuntal combination occurs in two successive spans, the first concluding with a modulation to the dominant key. At the midpoint of the episode, the preceding material yields to another variation of the original subject, which undergoes developmental treatment. Within this developmental passage, the inverted form of the subject emerges, interwoven with the ongoing contrapuntal fabric until the close of the section.
