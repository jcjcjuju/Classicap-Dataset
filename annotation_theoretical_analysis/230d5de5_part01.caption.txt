This constitutes the exposition, modulatory, and recapitulatory sections of a tonal fugue in G major. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the treble in the tonic key of G major, followed by a codetta modulating from G major to the dominant D major. The tonal answer then appears in the alto, transposed to D major, without a counter-subject, and is succeeded by another codetta that modulates back from D major to G major. The subject returns in the bass, again in G major, and is followed by a final codetta that modulates from G major to D major, closing firmly in the dominant. The modulatory section commences with Episode I, which sequentially modulates from D major through G major and A minor to E minor; this episode is derived motivically from the opening of the subject. The subject reappears in the bass in E minor, followed by a codetta modulating from E minor to its dominant, B minor. The tonal answer then enters in the treble in B minor, after which Episode II unfolds, modulating from B minor back to the tonic G major; this episode is constructed from the second bar of the subject, with imitation descending from treble through alto to bass. The recapitulatory section presents the subject in the alto in G major, followed by a coda that confirms the tonic key.
