This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of C minor, presented in a condensed version that omits the material corresponding to the original Bars 22–30, thereby preserving only the initial thematic material built exclusively upon tonic and dominant harmonies of C minor. The connecting episode follows, with its characteristic threefold repetition of a melodious phrase now transposed: the first statement appears in G flat major (replacing the original A flat major), the second repetition is also rendered in G flat major (instead of F minor), and the third iteration occurs in E flat minor (in place of D flat major); the pedal point that concludes this episode is sustained on C rather than the original B flat. The second subject then enters in F major—a key that diverges from the expected tonic—and is presented in a shortened form; however, at the subsequent juncture, the entire second subject recurs immediately in the tonic key of C minor. The movement concludes with a coda derived from the closing portion of the connecting episode, now transposed into and slightly altered within the tonic key of C minor. Notably, the subdominant chord appears only once across all principal thematic material and codas—specifically as the subdominant of E flat major—though this occurrence is carried over into the recapitulation through structural repetition.
