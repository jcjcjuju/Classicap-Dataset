This constitutes the recapitulatory section of a sonata-form movement, beginning with the second subject transposed into the tonic key rather than the customary return of the principal subject. The second subject retains its internal structure, presenting first a new melody in the tonic followed by a secondary portion that incorporates thematic material derived from the principal subject, now realigned to the tonic. This is succeeded by the third and final entry of the principal subject, which appears in the tonic key, slightly varied through ornamental elaboration and significantly extended by cadential repetition. The movement concludes with a brief coda that provides a final cadential confirmation of the tonic.
