This constitutes the coda of the movement. It is based on the initial three bars of the first subject theme and remains entirely within the tonic key of A major. The passage incorporates diminished seventh chords at two points, which introduce moments of chromatic tension while maintaining the overarching tonal stability of the tonic. The thematic material is derived directly from the opening gesture of the movement, preserving its characteristic melodic contour and rhythmic profile, yet framed within a conclusive context that reinforces the finality of the tonic.
