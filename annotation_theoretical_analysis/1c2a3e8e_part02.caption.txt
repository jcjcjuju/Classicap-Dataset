This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is prefaced by a transposition of the final three chords of the exposition’s coda into E minor, establishing a new harmonic context. The development principally engages with motivic fragments derived from the first subject, specifically material corresponding to Bars 5–9 of the exposition, which is subjected to developmental treatment. Throughout this section, the second subject is entirely absent from the musical discourse, with no thematic or motivic reference to its content. The harmonic language and texture are shaped exclusively by the reworking of the first subject’s material, maintaining a focus on motivic elaboration and tonal instability characteristic of the development function.
