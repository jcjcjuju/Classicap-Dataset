This constitutes a large-scale reprise and development of the secondary thematic material within a modified rondo or episodic structure. It begins with a transposed return of the main theme, now presented in D flat major and subsequently sequenced toward A flat major, before shifting to D flat minor. This is followed by a varied continuation in C sharp minor—the enharmonic equivalent of D flat minor—featuring a newly introduced semiquaver countermelody in the left hand. The passage modulates to E major, then cycles through C sharp minor to G sharp minor, culminating in a perfect cadence. A dominant pedal in broken octaves sustains tension over C sharp minor before an impassioned restatement of the preceding thematic material occurs. This restatement includes a sequential passage wherein the alto voice descends chromatically while the bass outlines a descending E major scale, resolving to the dominant chord of E major. The section then transitions into an extended developmental episode, wherein motives derived from the main theme are layered above an agitated dominant pedal, traversing a series of tonal areas: E major/minor, F major/minor, G minor, and finally A flat major. The development concludes with a dominant pedal in the bass over A flat major, accompanied by chromatically ascending minor thirds in the upper voices.
