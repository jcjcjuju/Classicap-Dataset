This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The principal subject is an eight-bar sentence in the tonic key, extended to twelve bars through cadential repetition. A transition follows, beginning in E minor and modulating through D major to A major; however, the tonic of A major is immediately abandoned, functioning instead as the dominant of D major, the key in which the second subject is presented. The second subject begins with a new melody in D major (the dominant) and is followed by a second portion that incorporates a thematic reference to the principal subject, now transposed into D major. Within this second portion, Bars 27–28 present an inversion of Bars 25–26. A short sequential passage ensues, comprising Bars 29–32 and repeated with slight modification in Bars 33–36, which features transient modulations through B minor, G major, and E minor before returning to D major and concluding with a full cadence in that key. The exposition closes with a second entry of the principal subject, now slightly varied.
