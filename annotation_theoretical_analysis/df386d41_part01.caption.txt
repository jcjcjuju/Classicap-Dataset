This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of F sharp minor and is preceded by an introductory bar. Within this subject, a modulation to G major occurs, introducing a tonal digression that is subsequently developed through a varied and extended repetition of the material originally spanning Bars 10–17, now elaborated through Bars 18–26. A connecting episode follows, commencing after a brief introductory bar with a new three-bar syncopated subject; this subject is immediately subjected to a varied repetition, succeeded by a further varied statement of its final bar, leading into a modulatory passage that establishes the dominant key of D major. The second subject then unfolds in D major, opening with a bass melody constructed solely from the D major triad; this phrase is immediately restated in the treble register. A varied reiteration of the same phrase appears again in the bass, now accompanied by semiquaver triplet figuration, and is correspondingly echoed in the treble with identical accompaniment. This is succeeded by a four-bar ascending treble passage supported by semiquaver accompaniment, with the bass initially sounding two octaves and a third below the treble line, shifting to a tenth below in the final bar of the passage. The second subject concludes with a full cadence in D major. The exposition closes with a coda that reinforces the final cadence of the second subject and terminates on a chord of the sixth.
