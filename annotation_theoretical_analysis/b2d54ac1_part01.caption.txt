This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, comprises a ten-bar thematic structure articulated as a 4 + 6 phrase grouping, which is extended to sixteen bars through the literal repetition of its second phrase; the section concludes with a perfect cadence in the tonic. A bridge-passage follows, functioning as a transition through an ascending sequential design, the latter portion of which develops an amplified variation of its opening motivic figure; this passage modulates successively through C major and G major before arriving at D major, the dominant key. The second subject unfolds in D major and is divided into two distinct sections. The first section begins with a four-bar phrase that is immediately restated in a varied form; following a full cadence in D major, an unusual proportional repetition occurs, wherein five of the preceding seven bars are reprised. Within this material, voice-leading inversion is evident, and specific harmonic events include the third inversion of the dominant minor ninth chord in A major and G major, keys through which the music briefly modulates. The second section commences with the treble presenting the transition’s opening figure, imitated in the bass at the interval of a fourth (or eleventh) below; subsequent bars derive motivically from the initial phrase of the first section of the second subject, and a varied repetition of this derived material follows shortly thereafter. The exposition concludes with a perfect cadence in D major, reiterated twice over a brief tonic pedal point.
