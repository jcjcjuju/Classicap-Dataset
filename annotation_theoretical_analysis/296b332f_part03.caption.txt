This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in its original key of G major, preserving its initial thematic identity. It is followed by a modified connecting episode, which reworks the material from the exposition so as to conclude on the dominant harmony rather than modulating to the dominant key. The second subject then appears transposed to the tonic key of G major, thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of recapitulatory practice. The movement concludes with a coda that initially mirrors the supplementary subject material presented in the exposition; this is subsequently succeeded by a variation of the first subject, set above a sustained tonic pedal point.
