This constitutes the exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory section of a real fugue in D major, characterized by the absence of a countersubject and the consistent use of a real answer. The exposition begins with the subject stated in the tenor in the tonic key of D major, immediately followed by a real answer in the alto in the dominant key of A major. A brief codetta ensues, after which the subject reappears in the treble in D major, leading into Stretto I, wherein the answer enters in the bass in A major while the treble subject is still sounding. The modulatory section commences with Episode I, which modulates from A major through D major and back to A major; this episode, like all others in the movement, is constructed from the last four notes of the subject. The subject then appears in the alto in E minor, followed by the answer in the treble in B minor, and a codetta that modulates from B minor back to A major. Stretto II unfolds with the answer in the alto in D major overlapping with the subject in the treble in the same key. Episode II follows, modulating from D major to A major, where it concludes. The subject reappears in the tenor in B minor, initiating Stretto III with the answer in the treble in B minor, alongside an altered statement of the subject in the alto in the same key. A codetta then modulates to F-sharp minor, in which the answer is stated in the bass and the section closes. Stretto IV occurs in D major, featuring the answer in the bass followed at the distance of one beat by the answer in the treble, with a fragment of the answer interpolated in the alto. Episode III modulates from D major to G major, preceding Stretto V, which presents the subject simultaneously in the tenor, alto, and treble in G major, with the bass providing complementary material. Episode IV then modulates from G major back to D major, leading to a final statement of the subject in the tenor in D major, followed by a codetta and an altered answer in the bass in A major, accompanied by an early fragment of the answer in the tenor. The recapitulatory section features Stretto VI, in which the answer appears in the treble in A major while the subject is simultaneously presented in the alto, tenor
