This constitutes the exposition, counter-exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in C sharp major. The exposition begins with the subject stated in the bass in the tonic key, followed by a tonal answer in the treble in G sharp major, with no counter-subject. The subject then appears in the alto by inversion in the tonic, succeeded by a codetta in C sharp major. Further entries follow: the subject in the treble (tonic), answered in the alto (tonic); the subject again in the bass (tonic), then in the treble by diminution in G sharp major, answered in the alto by diminution in D sharp minor. The subject next appears in the bass by both diminution and inversion in A sharp minor, leading to a codetta that modulates from A sharp minor to G sharp major. A counter-exposition ensues, opening with the subject in the bass in G sharp major, answered in the alto (G sharp major) and then in the treble in F sharp major. This is followed by two stretti: Stretto I presents the subject by inversion in the bass and alto in D sharp minor, with a concurrent answer in the treble in G sharp major; Stretto II features the subject by inversion in the bass and treble in C sharp major, with an answer in the alto in the tonic, concluding with a subject entry in the bass in F sharp major.

The modulatory section commences with Episode I, which modulates from F sharp major through A sharp to E sharp major. This is followed by Stretto III, wherein the subject appears in the bass and in the treble by inversion, both in A sharp minor, with an answer in the alto in D sharp minor; a subsequent entry of the subject by inversion in the treble occurs in G sharp major. A codetta then modulates from G sharp major back to the tonic. The subject reappears in the bass in C sharp major, followed by entries in the alto by inversion and diminution (tonic), then in the bass by inversion and diminution in D sharp minor, and again in the bass by diminution in F sharp major. Episode II follows, modulating from F sharp major through C sharp major and back to F sharp major. An answer in the bass in C sharp major leads into Stretto IV, which presents the subject in the tre
