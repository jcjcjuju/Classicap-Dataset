This constitutes the exposition of a binary form, comprising two contrasting periods that establish the tonic-dominant tonal polarity characteristic of classical tonal practice. Period I presents a thematic statement derived from the opening motivic figure, unfolding over a structural span that culminates in a perfect cadence in the dominant key of E-flat major. This period contains an internal subdivision, suggesting a symmetrical or antecedent-consequent phrasing strategy. Period II commences directly on the dominant harmony and reasserts the primary thematic material, now transposed to initiate in the dominant key before modulating back to the tonic. It concludes with a perfect cadence in the tonic key of A-flat major, thereby fulfilling the tonal resolution expected in the second half of a binary exposition. Embedded within the latter portion of Period II is a coda, which reinforces the tonic key through free imitation of the principal theme arranged in a descending sequence, providing additional harmonic and motivic confirmation of the original key.
