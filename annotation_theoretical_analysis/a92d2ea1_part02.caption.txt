This constitutes the second part of a binary form, functioning as the complementary section to the initial binary structure. It opens with a three-bar introduction that establishes a preparatory gesture for the new tonal area. The first subject follows in B-flat major (the tonic of this section), comprising a two-bar thematic statement immediately succeeded by an inversion of its second bar, thereby creating a three-bar phrase with internal symmetry. This is succeeded by a second subject presented in F major (the dominant key), which unfolds as a canon at the octave below; this contrapuntal treatment begins and concludes firmly within the dominant harmony. A development ensues that overlaps with the conclusion of the second subject, maintaining strict canonic procedure at the octave throughout. It initiates with motivic material derived from the bass line of the preceding first subject, subsequently introducing a new figuration at its midpoint. The first subject then returns in its original key of B-flat major, now accompanied by a treble pedal point that sustains harmonic stability. The second subject reappears transposed to the tonic key of B-flat major, with its antecedent phrase now situated in the bass rather than the treble as in its initial presentation, preserving the canonic relationship while altering registral distribution. The section concludes with a transitional passage that prepares for the da capo return of the first part: its initial segment draws rhythmic motives from the earlier introduction, while its latter portion reproduces material originally associated with the dominant pedal of F, thereby reinforcing the dominant of the global tonic and facilitating the structural return.
