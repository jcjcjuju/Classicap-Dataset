This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, unfolds as a twelve-bar sentence comprising three distinct phrases, extended to fifteen bars through cadential repetitions. Its opening features a scale passage in thirds in the treble, which is imitated in the bass by a passage in octaves; this imitation, in conjunction with the alto voice, effectively bridges the rhythmic gap in the melody created by a half-cadence on a prolonged B♭. The subsequent bridge-passage or transition introduces a new motivic figure and modulates to the dominant key, B♭ major, achieving a half-cadence in that key by its conclusion. A brief linking measure connects this transition to the second subject, which is presented in B♭ major—the dominant—and spans nineteen bars through extension by cadential repetition. The second subject is structured as a single sentence, with its fore-phrase characterized by bass imitation of the melody at the interval of a tenth below; Bars 30–31 present a sequential repetition of the preceding two bars. The entire exposition is marked for literal repetition.
