This constitutes the exposition of a modified ternary form with an appended closing section. The opening subsection establishes F major through two balanced phrases: the first unfolds over a tonic pedal in the bass, featuring a melody that ascends an octave from the lower to upper tonic via repeated notes, stepwise motion, and narrow intervals, initiated by a softly reiterated dominant; the second phrase emphasizes the tonic chord in second inversion before culminating in a strong V⁷–I cadence with the melody resolving to the tonic on a metrically accented beat. This material is then restated with subtle alterations—specifically, a syncopated rhythmic profile introduced through tied notes, reduced repetition of the opening dominant pitch, and a marginally enriched textural density—while preserving the original harmonic and melodic contours.

An episode follows, maintaining the four-bar phrase structure but initiating with a syncopated gesture analogous to the altered repetition. It modulates sequentially through A minor to C major, the dominant key, thereby expanding the tonal field. This leads into a transposed rendition of the closing portion of the initial thematic material, now cast in C major, which subsequently retransitions to F major and seamlessly reintroduces the primary thematic content. However, upon this return, the anticipated V⁷–I cadence in F major is evaded; instead, the harmony abruptly shifts to A minor, and the subsequent phrase—transposed up a third from the original second phrase—concludes with a V⁷–i cadence in A minor, signaling a tonal instability that foreshadows later developments.

The closing subsection commences with diminished seventh chords alternating with Siciliana rhythms, the latter permeating both upper and lower voices. These elements propel a series of V⁷–I cadential gestures in F major, reiterated across successive phrases. Notably, the dominant seventh chord is inflected with an added sixth (A), which replaces the conventional fifth and is prominently sustained in the upper voice, ultimately persisting into the final bar as a tonal harbinger of A minor’s growing dominance over the home key of F major.
