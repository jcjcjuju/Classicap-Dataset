This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of F minor as an eight-bar sentence divided into two four-bar phrases: the initial phrase concludes with an interrupted cadence, while the second achieves a full cadence. No bridge passage intervenes between the first and second subjects. The second subject appears in A-flat major—the relative major—and spans just over twelve bars, featuring imitative textures among the voices. Within this section, a German sixth chord occurs, as well as a first-inversion supertonic minor ninth chord. A codetta follows, derived motivically from the opening figure of the movement. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
