This constitutes the introduction to the sonata form. The section is founded upon a one-bar thematic cell that serves as the generative material for the entire introduction. It exhibits a highly modulatory character, avoiding prolonged harmonic stability, and culminates on a dominant minor ninth chord, thereby creating tonal ambiguity and forward momentum into the exposition.
