This constitutes the second part of a binary form, itself structured in simple binary design. It opens with a statement of the first subject in D♭ major, the tonic key established in the preceding part. This thematic material is followed by an episode that introduces contrasting content. The latter portion of the section presents a reminiscence of the first subject, returning to the original key; however, this is not a regular or literal restatement, but rather a varied evocation that avoids a conventional thematic return. The section concludes with a repeat sign that directs a return to the beginning of the episode, thereby enclosing the episode and the subsequent reminiscence within a repeated frame.
