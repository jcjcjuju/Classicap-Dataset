This constitutes the exposition’s first subject group in a sonata-form movement. The material is predominantly derived from a two-bar thematic cell presented at the outset in B flat major, the tonic key. An initial eight-bar phrase, concluding on the dominant harmony, is subsequently restated an octave higher with slight alterations. Following this, a developmental passage ensues, elaborating motivically on the opening idea; this developmental segment is itself subjected to immediate repetition with minor variation, thereby reinforcing its thematic and harmonic content within the tonic key area.
