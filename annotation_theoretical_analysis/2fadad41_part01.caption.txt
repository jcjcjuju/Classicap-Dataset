This constitutes the exposition, development, and recapitulation of a sonata-form structure. The first subject begins in the tonic key of F minor with a four-bar phrase, which is subsequently restated in the relative major (A♭ major); this latter statement spans a four-bar span and culminates in a cadence in A♭ major. Within this exposition, the right-hand material from the second phrase undergoes inversion in the following two bars, and the closing four-bar phrase is repeated. The development section that follows draws exclusively upon motivic content from the first subject. The recapitulation presents a varied and abbreviated return of the first subject, now adjusted to begin and conclude firmly in the tonic key of F minor, thereby fulfilling the tonal requirements of sonata form. The entire section is enclosed by a double bar and repeat sign.
