This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of E major and opens with a four-bar sentence articulated over a tonic pedal point. This thematic material undergoes immediate sequential treatment: the content of the fifth bar is restated a minor ninth lower in the following bar, the seventh bar is transposed a minor ninth higher, and the material from bars nine to ten reappears a minor ninth lower in bars eleven to twelve. The conclusion of the first subject overlaps with the onset of the connecting episode, which itself initiates with the first two bars of the first subject. The transition modulates to F♯ major—the dominant of the upcoming second subject—and concludes in that key. The second subject unfolds in B major and begins with two four-bar phrases; the second phrase imitates the first at the interval of a second lower. These phrases are subsequently repeated with minor alterations in the bass line. A further four-bar phrase, cadencing in the dominant key, follows and is immediately repeated. At this point, a new motivic figure is introduced, which some analysts regard as the beginning of the coda; the second subject ultimately closes in the dominant key, with a notable instance of consecutive fifths occurring within this section. The exposition concludes with a coda whose bass line derives from the first subject, effecting a modulation from the dominant back to the tonic key at its close. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
