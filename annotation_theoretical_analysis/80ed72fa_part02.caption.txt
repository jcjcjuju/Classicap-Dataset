This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section commences with an introductory bar followed by a statement of the opening four-bar phrase of the first subject, now transposed to E major. Subsequently, material derived from the connecting episode—specifically the passage originally spanning Bars 25–32—is restated with slight alterations in the key of D♭ major. The development culminates in an extended prolongation of the chord of the minor ninth of the dominant, which saturates the harmonic texture from Bars 124–135; this harmonic stasis is accompanied in its final five bars by the motivic figure first introduced in Bar 11 of the exposition. Throughout, the development integrates thematic elements from both the first and second subjects as well as the connecting episode, subjecting them to recontextualization through modulation and fragmentation.
