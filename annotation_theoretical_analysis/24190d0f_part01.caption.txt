This constitutes the exposition, counter-exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory section of a fugue in E major. The exposition begins with the subject stated in the bass in the tonic key of E major, followed by a real answer in the tenor in the dominant key of B major, accompanied by the counter-subject in the bass. The subject then appears in the alto in E major with the counter-subject in the tenor, and the answer follows in the soprano in B major with the counter-subject in the alto. This is succeeded by Episode I, which modulates from E major to B major. A counter-exposition ensues, initiated by an answer in the alto in E major without the counter-subject, followed by Stretto I: the subject enters in the tenor in E major, immediately overlapped by the answer in the bass in E major, and then the subject in the treble with the counter-subject in the tenor.

The modulatory section commences with Episode II, which modulates from E major through F-sharp minor to C-sharp minor, concluding with a cadence in the latter key. The subject then appears in the alto in C-sharp minor, followed by Stretto II: an answer in the treble in E major without the counter-subject. After a brief gap, the subject reappears in the bass in B major, immediately followed by Stretto III: an answer in the tenor in F-sharp minor, again without the counter-subject. Episode III follows, modulating from F-sharp minor back to C-sharp minor. A series of entries by diminution then occurs: the subject in the treble in E major, followed by Stretto IV with the subject in the alto by diminution in E major, then the subject in the tenor by diminution in B major simultaneously with the answer in the bass by diminution in B major. This is followed by the subject in the bass by diminution in B major and a final statement of the subject in the alto in its original rhythmic form. Episode IV then modulates to G-sharp minor and closes in that key.

The recapitulatory section begins with a simultaneous statement of the answer in the alto and the subject in the tenor by inversion and diminution, both in E major. This initiates Stretto V, in which the subject continues in the tenor in
