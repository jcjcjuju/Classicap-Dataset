This constitutes the exposition of a rondo form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of G major and is bipartite in structure: the initial phrase cadences in the dominant key, while the subsequent phrase begins in the dominant and concludes with an authentic cadence in the tonic. Both phrases are repeated. An episode follows, opening with an eight-bar sentence in E minor, which functions as a contrasting key area. This is succeeded by a passage derived motivically from the first subject, effecting a modulation that returns to the tonic key. The first subject then reappears in its original tonic, now accompanied by a varied texture, and is presented without internal repetition.
