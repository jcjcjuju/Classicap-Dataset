This constitutes the final large-scale formal section of the movement, functioning as a recapitulatory and concluding area that reaffirms the tonic key of G major. It begins with a full statement of the first subject in its original key, preserving its thematic identity and tonal stability. This is followed by an extended passage of twenty-nine bars characterized by fragmentation, wherein motives derived from the first subject are developed in a disjointed and episodic manner, creating a sense of instability while remaining rooted in the tonic. Subsequently, a self-contained episode appears, substituting for the expected return of the second subject; this episode both begins and ends firmly in G major and is motivically based on a two-bar cell. The movement concludes with a curtailed restatement of the first subject, now underpinned by a sustained tonic pedal point that reinforces harmonic closure and structural finality.
