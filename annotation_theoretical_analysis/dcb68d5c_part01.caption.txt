This constitutes a hybrid binary-ternary form that serves as the structural basis for the Air and its variations (excluding Variation VII), with a parallel minor adaptation in Variation VII. In the Air and all variations except No. VII, the initial section (A) presents a sentence structure articulated in the tonic key of D major, followed by a transposition or harmonic shift to the dominant key of A major. This A section is followed by a B section comprising the first phrase of a second sentence, which concludes with a half cadence in D major—though in Variations IX, X, and XI, this half cadence occurs in the tonic rather than the dominant. The final component (A2) consists of the second phrase of the second sentence, which returns to material derived from the opening phrase of the first sentence, thereby creating a rounded or referential closure. Both the A and A2 sections are enclosed by double bars and are typically repeated, except in Variations XI and XII. In Variation VII, the entire structure is transposed into the tonic minor (D minor), with the A section unfolding as a sentence in D minor followed by its dominant minor (A minor). The B section again comprises two phrases of a second sentence: the first ending on a half cadence in D minor, and the second returning to a phrase from the initial sentence. This minor-mode variant also features double bars with repeats.
