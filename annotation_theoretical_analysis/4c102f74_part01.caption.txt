This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject presents an eight-bar melody in the tonic key of A major, characterized by dotted rhythms and supported by an almost-continuous quaver accompaniment; it concludes with a perfect cadence in A major. Within this section, a brief modulation to B minor occurs, followed by a variant of the theme in F sharp minor—the relative minor—where the bass imitates the treble. The opening thematic material then returns in A major with minor variations. A very brief transition follows, introducing triplet figuration that establishes a new accompanimental rhythm and employing a D sharp to facilitate an enharmonic modulation into the dominant key of E major. The second subject unfolds as an eight-bar melody in E major, culminating in a perfect cadence; after a four-bar interlude, the theme is restated in the bass, initially in E minor and then in F minor, before reestablishing E major. The exposition concludes with a closing subject in E major, featuring chromatic inflections and a frequent tonic pedal in the bass, while rhythmically deriving its material from the second subject.
