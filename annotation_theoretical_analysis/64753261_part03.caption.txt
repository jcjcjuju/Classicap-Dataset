This constitutes the recapitulation and coda of a sonata-form movement. The principal subject returns in the tonic key, followed by a modified transition that is reworked to remain within the tonic and prepare for the second subject in the same key. The second subject, now transposed from its original dominant-key presentation to the tonic D major, retains its internal structure as a sixteen-bar sentence with a half cadence at its midpoint, subsequently varied to conclude with a full cadence; this is followed by an eight-bar sentence that is repeated and extended through cadential elaboration. A brief link leads to a final statement of the principal subject in the tonic, which is then followed by accessory bars that elaborate upon its material. The movement concludes with a coda that alludes to the opening portion of the transition and is extended through cadential repetition, thereby reinforcing the tonic key.
