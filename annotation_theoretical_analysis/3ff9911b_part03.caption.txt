This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The principal subject appears in its third statement, presented in the tonic key without alteration. This is followed by a transitional passage that initiates in D minor and modulates to the tonic minor, A minor, with a brief intermediary passage through E major; the initial portion of this transition exhibits a short modulating sequence. The second subject then returns in the tonic key, now modified, with its latter portion constituting a slightly altered repetition of the corresponding segment from its initial presentation. The recapitulation concludes with a coda that draws exclusively upon material from the exposition, yet pointedly avoids reference to the principal subject.
