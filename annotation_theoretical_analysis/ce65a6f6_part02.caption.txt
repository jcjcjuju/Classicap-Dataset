This constitutes the recapitulatory and concluding portion of the movement. It opens with a brief digression in C major that evokes thematic material associated with the first subject, though no full statement occurs due to the omission of a third subject. The second subject then reappears in a significantly abbreviated form, beginning with a transitional passage that alludes to the initial segment of the original second subject before modulating to the tonic key of E major, wherein the latter portion of the second subject is presented. The developmental and varied-repetitive material corresponding to Bars 26–42 from the exposition is entirely omitted. A varied restatement of the first subject follows in the tonic key, leading into a coda that draws upon motives from the first subject to conclude the movement.
