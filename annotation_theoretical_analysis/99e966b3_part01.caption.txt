This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of D major, comprising a four-bar phrase that concludes on the dominant harmony, followed by a six-bar phrase culminating in a full cadential closure in the tonic. A connecting episode ensues, initially continuing thematic material from the first subject; its latter portion constitutes a varied and expanded reworking of the opening five bars of the movement, ultimately arriving at the dominant of the relative minor (B minor). The second subject unfolds in two distinct segments: the first commences in B minor and undergoes modulations through F♯ minor, A major, and E major before cadencing in A major; the second segment opens with an eight-bar sentence in A major, partially restated in A minor, and introduces a new phrase whose bass line derives from the initial bars of the first subject—this idea is subjected to extended development until Bar 88, where a passage in A major concludes the second subject group. A coda follows, featuring new thematic material alongside a subtle allusion to the first subject, predominantly sustained over a pedal point. The exposition concludes with a transitional passage that prepares for its literal repetition, as indicated by the double bar and repeat sign.
