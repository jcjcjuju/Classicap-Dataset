This constitutes the exposition of a sonata-rondo form. It opens with the principal subject in the tonic key, structured as two sentences wherein the second functions as a series of cadential extensions beyond the perfect cadence of the first. The initial motive undergoes immediate sequential treatment, repeated a step lower, and the second phrase (Bars 4–8) presents a modified repetition of the opening, adjusted to conclude with a perfect cadence rather than a half cadence. A bridge passage follows, derived motivically from the latter portion of the principal subject, effecting a modulation to F major—the dominant—by Bar 22 and culminating in a half cadence in that key. This leads directly into the second subject (Episode I), presented in F major. This episode features an asymmetrical phrase structure: a three-bar phrase is followed by a five-bar phrase, the latter extended through the interpolation of an additional measure; notably, its cadential bars replicate those of the principal subject’s closing (Bars 7–8), transposed into the dominant, reflecting vestiges of binary form practice. A brief ad libitum link, marked by a fermata and resolving to two quarter notes, connects this episode to a partial reprise of the principal subject in the tonic, comprising only its first eight bars. This truncated restatement concludes with a chromatic link—C, C♯, D—that prepares the subsequent episode.
