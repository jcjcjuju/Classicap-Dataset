This constitutes the exposition of a fugal first subject within a larger formal design, functioning as the primary thematic area in the tonic key of A-flat major. The section opens with a three-voice fugue, the subject introduced in the bass and firmly rooted in the tonic, followed by a regular answer in the dominant (E-flat major), accompanied by a countersubject in quavers. A brief codetta precedes the subject’s entry in the treble, after which a sequential episode derived from the subject’s final four notes modulates to the dominant key. Further fugal entries alternate between subject and answer, interspersed with episodes: one based on the countersubject leads to another answer, followed by an episode resembling the earlier sequential passage, now modulating to C minor, where a fragment of the subject appears in the bass. A new episodic subject emerges, succeeded by a statement of the fugue subject in D-flat major, answered in the dominant of that key. Subsequent entries feature the subject with partial stretto treatment. The entire fugal exposition concludes on a dominant seventh chord. This is followed by an episode that alludes motivically to material from the third movement, transposed down a semitone into G minor; though significantly altered and abbreviated, it culminates in G minor before transitioning into a G-major coda that extends its model from the third movement. The fugue subject then reappears in inverted form in G major, with a regular answer, and undergoes developmental treatment in this inverted guise until the close of the section.
