This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of E major, structured as a complete sentence: it opens with a four-bar phrase concluding on a dominant seventh harmony, followed by two two-bar phrases, the latter being an exact transposition of the former a minor ninth lower. A shortened repetition of this first subject follows immediately. An episode ensues, derived motivically from a figure introduced in the fifth bar of the first subject and remaining entirely within the dominant key of B major. The second subject then appears in B major, articulated as a four-bar sentence that is subsequently repeated with slight variation. The first subject returns in its original tonic key, after which a second episode commences with a thematic reminiscence of the first subject now cast in E minor; this episode modulates to G major, where the characteristic figure from the initial episode is restated above a dominant pedal point in the new key.
