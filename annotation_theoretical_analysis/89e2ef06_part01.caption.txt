This constitutes the first part of a simple binary form. The section opens with a first subject in the tonic key of D major, which concludes with a cadence in the dominant key of A major. This initial statement is followed by a slightly altered repetition of the same thematic material, transposed to the dominant key. The combined span of these two statements is then presented again with further slight alterations, maintaining the tonal trajectory established in the preceding iteration. A developmental passage ensues, structured as a sequential progression: an initial four-bar idea is successively restated first in A major and then in B minor, culminating in a dominant seventh harmony. The part concludes with a return of the first subject in its original tonic key of D major; this restatement is both slightly altered and extended in length, ultimately achieving closure in the tonic.
