This constitutes the exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory coda of a tonal fugue in A flat major. The exposition begins with the subject stated in the tenor in the tonic key, followed by a tonal answer in the bass in the dominant (E flat major), accompanied by a free counter-subject in the tenor. A brief codetta ensues before the subject reappears in the treble in the tonic, supported partially by the counter-subject in the bass; this is succeeded by an answer in the alto in the dominant, now without counter-subject. Episode I follows, modulating from E flat major back to A flat major, and leads to a further subject entry in the tenor with a varied counter-subject in the bass. The modulatory section commences with Episode II, which effects a modulation from A flat major to F minor; this is followed by a subject statement in the alto in F minor with a varied counter-subject in the tenor. Episode III then modulates from F minor to B flat minor, after which the subject appears in the tenor in B flat minor without counter-subject, immediately followed by an answer in the alto in the same key. Episode IV modulates from B flat minor back to A flat major and introduces fragmented subject and answer material in the alto and treble, respectively. Subsequent entries include an altered answer in the alto in A flat major with counter-subject in the tenor, a subject in the treble that implies a shift to E flat major with counter-subject in the tenor, and simultaneously a varied subject in the alto developed into a sequence of suspended ninths in A flat major. Episode V then unfolds as a sequential modulation from D flat major to A flat major, underpinned by suspended figures in the upper voices and a running tenor derived from the counter-subject. Further entries follow: the subject in the bass in A flat major, an answer in the tenor in C minor, another answer in the alto with a free version of the counter-subject in the tenor in A flat major, and finally an answer in the treble in D flat major. The recapitulatory section takes the form of a coda in A flat major, featuring a subject statement in the treble and a final reminiscence of the counter-subject in the alto.
