This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first thematic subject is presented in four distinct phrases, articulated through a systematic exchange of contrapuntal roles: the melodic figure initially stated in the treble during the first and third phrases is reassigned to the bass in the second and fourth phrases, while the bass figure from the first and third phrases is correspondingly transferred to the treble in the second and fourth. This thematic material is reiterated across multiple keys, culminating in a cadence in the relative minor. Following this, a modulatory section ensues, characterized by harmonic instability until the thematic subject reappears in the subdominant key. The movement then proceeds with a return of the opening subject, now subjected to progressive textural and harmonic reduction through the sustained use of dominant pedal points, ultimately leading into an extended coda that further elaborates the dominant pedal and concludes the movement.
