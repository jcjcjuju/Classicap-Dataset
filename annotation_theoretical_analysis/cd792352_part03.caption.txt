This constitutes the second variation of a theme-and-variations structure. The harmonic content is presented entirely through arpeggiated figuration, with the underlying chordal progressions articulated as broken chords rather than block harmonies. The variation retains the phrase structure and harmonic framework of the original air, unfolding in two eight-bar sections each composed of two four-bar phrases, and culminates in a perfect cadence on the tonic chord.
