This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of F minor; its rhythmic profile initiates on the third beat of the opening measure, following an introductory gesture in the first half of that bar, and concludes on a dominant harmony. A connecting episode follows, beginning in the tonic key with the second part of the first subject, then restating the first part of that subject transposed to G major—the dominant of the upcoming second subject’s key. This transition culminates in a five-bar prolongation of the dominant seventh chord of C minor, preparing the entrance of the second subject. The second subject appears not in the conventional relative major (A-flat major) but in the dominant minor (C minor), and comprises two distinct thematic spans, each concluding with a full cadence. The exposition closes with a coda derived motivically from the first subject. The entire exposition is marked for literal repetition.
