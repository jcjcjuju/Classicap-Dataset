This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with a thematic reference to the first subject, initiating the developmental process through motivic recall. Subsequently, a portion of the second subject is introduced in F sharp minor, with its melodic content transposed to the bass register. The latter portion of the development is constructed upon a dominant pedal point, sustaining harmonic tension through prolonged dominant harmony that prepares for the eventual return to the tonic key in the recapitulation.
