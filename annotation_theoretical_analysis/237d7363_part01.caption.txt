This constitutes the exposition, counter-exposition, and subsequent modulatory and recapitulatory sections of a real fugue in G sharp minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the treble in the tonic key, followed by a real answer in the alto in the dominant key of D sharp minor, accompanied by a countersubject in the treble. A codetta modulates from D sharp minor through B major back to G sharp minor. The subject then reappears in the bass in the tonic, without the countersubject, followed by another codetta returning from B major to G sharp minor. A redundant entry of the subject occurs in the alto, now with the countersubject in the bass, reversing their registral relationship from the initial exposition. Episode I modulates from G sharp minor to D sharp minor, leading to an answer in the bass without countersubject. Episode II continues through B major to D sharp minor, followed by another answer in the treble, again without countersubject. Episode III modulates back to G sharp minor, after which the subject returns in the bass with a slightly altered countersubject in the alto. A codetta then modulates from G sharp minor to D sharp major, followed by a passage in which the theme is absent and only the countersubject appears in the treble in D sharp minor. Another brief codetta returns the tonality to G sharp minor, and the countersubject appears alone again in the alto. The modulatory section commences with the countersubject in the bass in C sharp minor (the subdominant minor), followed by a codetta returning to G sharp minor. The countersubject then appears by itself in the treble in the tonic. Episode IV modulates from G sharp minor through D sharp minor and back to G sharp minor. The subject reenters in the bass with the countersubject in the alto in the tonic, followed by a codetta modulating to D sharp minor. An answer appears in the treble with the countersubject in the alto in the dominant, succeeded by a codetta that modulates through G sharp minor to C sharp minor. The subject then appears in the alto with the countersubject in the treble in E major, followed by Episode V modulating back to G sharp minor. The recapitulatory section begins with the subject in the alto and countersubject in the bass in the tonic, followed by Episode VI modulating
