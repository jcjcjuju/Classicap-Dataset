This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject unfolds as a sixteen-bar sentence structured in four-bar periodic phrasing, establishing the tonic key; it reaches a half-cadence in the tonic at its midpoint, after which the melody is restated an octave lower, with the final phrase altered to conclude with a perfect cadence. The subsequent bridge-passage begins over a tonic pedal in F major and features a phrase immediately repeated with upper-voice inversion; this is followed by a short descending sequence that modulates to C major, culminating in a reiterated cadence on G—the dominant of C major—thereby preparing the entrance of the second subject. The second subject, presented in the dominant key of C major, comprises a single thematic sentence whose second half constitutes a varied repetition of its first, expanded through cadential extension of its closing phrase. Notably, the initial two-bar idea expands to three bars upon repetition, and a three-bar phrase structure is confirmed through comparison of analogous passages. Additionally, the left-hand accompaniment during the second half of the subject imitates the melody a tenth below, and semiquaver figuration in the latter portion recalls similar passagework from the first subject. The exposition concludes with a codetta that derives its opening motive from the initial gesture of the first subject and incorporates semiquaver figures thematically linked to earlier material in the exposition. The entire exposition is marked for literal repetition.
