This constitutes the final rotational section of a rondo form, comprising a varied return of the first subject, a subsequent episode, a further varied statement of the first subject, and a coda. The first subject reappears in the tonic key of D major, presented with variation. This is followed by an episode that initiates with material analogous to the episode in the first rotational section; it concludes with new thematic content derived from the rhythmic profile of the opening figure of the first subject. A second varied rendition of the first subject ensues, again in the tonic key. The movement concludes with an extended coda featuring a rising sequential passage, a structural pause on a chord of the eleventh, contrapuntal interplay between a bass statement of the first subject’s thematic figure and chromatic scalar passages in the treble, and a sustained pedal point that persists to the final cadence.
