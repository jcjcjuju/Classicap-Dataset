This constitutes the recapitulation and coda of a sonata-form movement. The first subject returns in the tonic key of D major, presented with minimal alteration save for the inversion of the material originally found in Bars 8–11. Following this restatement, the coda commences with motivic development derived from the figure introduced in Bars 9–10 of the first subject. A brief reminiscence of the first subject appears in D minor, after which the initial two phrases of the first subject reemerge in a considerably varied form, culminating in a full cadence in the tonic key. This final cadential statement is subsequently repeated in varied form to conclude the movement.
