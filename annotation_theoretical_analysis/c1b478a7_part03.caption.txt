This constitutes the final thematic return and coda of a rondo-like structure. The first subject reappears in its original tonic key of G major, presented without alteration. Following this statement, the expected recurrence of the episode and a subsequent fourth entry of the first subject are omitted, streamlining the formal trajectory toward closure. The movement concludes with a coda that alludes motivically to the first subject. This coda initiates a series of transient modulations, briefly visiting C major and A minor, before firmly reestablishing the tonic key of G major for the final cadence.
