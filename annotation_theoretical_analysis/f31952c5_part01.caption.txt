This constitutes the exposition, counter-exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in F major. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the alto in the tonic key of F major, followed by a tonal answer in the treble in the dominant key of C major, accompanied by a counter-subject in the alto. The subject then reappears in the bass in F major, with the counter-subject transferred to the treble. This is followed by Episode I, which modulates from F major to C major and back. A counter-exposition ensues, initiated by the subject in the treble in F major, with the counter-subject distributed between the alto and bass; this is followed by an answer in the alto in C major with the counter-subject in the treble, and then another statement of the subject in the bass in F major with the counter-subject again in the treble. The counter-exposition concludes with an incomplete stretto (Stretto I), featuring the subject in the alto and the final portion of the counter-subject in the bass.

The modulatory section commences with Episode II, modulating from F major to D minor. This leads into Stretto II, a complete stretto in D minor with the subject appearing successively in the treble, alto, and bass, culminating in a close in D minor. A further complete stretto (Stretto III) follows in G minor, with the subject stated in the bass, alto, and treble in succession, concluding with a close in G minor. Episode III then modulates from G minor back to the tonic key of F major.

The recapitulatory section opens with an incomplete stretto (Stretto IV) in F major, presenting a florid version of the subject in the treble alongside an answer in the alto. The movement concludes with a coda in F major.
