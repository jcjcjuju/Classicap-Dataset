This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. It opens with the first subject in E flat major, the tonic key, establishing the primary thematic material. This is followed by a connecting episode that does not derive from prior thematic content; instead, it functions as an independent episode beginning in the tonic key and effecting a modulation to the dominant. The second subject then appears in B flat major, the dominant key, presenting the contrasting thematic material characteristic of the exposition’s secondary key area. The exposition concludes with a coda that reinforces the structural closure in the dominant key.
