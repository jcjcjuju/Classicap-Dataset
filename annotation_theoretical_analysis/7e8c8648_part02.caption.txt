This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage is primarily composed of fresh material, though it incorporates fleeting references to the first subject without engaging in systematic thematic development. These allusions include motivic echoes in the bass figures at the outset, as well as surface-level correspondences between specific phrases—most notably, a resemblance between a later phrase and material from the original first subject, which represents the sole instance approaching thematic treatment. Harmonically, the section is characterized by transient modulations: it begins by briefly establishing C major, then shifts to A minor, and later executes a more decisive modulation to A minor, which serves as a pivot for further tonal excursions through F major and D minor before arriving at C minor and ultimately reaffirming the tonic key of C major. The harmonic language includes both diatonic and chromatic forms of the inverted dominant ninth chord in G major. The section concludes with a dominant prolongation that originates in C minor and resolves into C major, followed by a brief transitional link that prepares the return of the first subject in the recapitulation.
