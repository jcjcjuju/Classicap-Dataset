This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of G major, though it is significantly abbreviated: the second section of the original first subject is omitted, and only a partial recurrence of the initial four-bar phrase appears, without its full repetition an octave higher as heard in the exposition. The connecting episode that follows is substantially reworked; it opens with material from the first section of the first subject, then modulates to C major and is extended into a five-bar phrase. The subsequent portion of this episode draws thematic content from the second part of the exposition’s second subject, before concluding with the closing gesture of the original connecting episode. The second subject then appears transposed entirely into the tonic key of G major, preserving its internal structure while fulfilling the tonal resolution characteristic of recapitulation. Finally, the coda—also transposed into the tonic—reiterates material derived from the second subject and the connecting episode figure, thereby reinforcing tonal stability at the movement’s close.
