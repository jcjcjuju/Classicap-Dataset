This constitutes the exposition, counter-exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in A flat major. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the alto in the tonic key, followed by a tonal answer in the treble in the dominant (E flat major), accompanied by a chromatic counter-subject in the alto. A brief codetta modulates back to A flat major, leading to a statement of the subject in the tenor with the counter-subject now in the treble. This is answered in the bass in E flat major, again with the counter-subject in the tenor. Episode I follows, modulating from E flat back to A flat and incorporating motivic material derived from the subject. The counter-exposition then commences with the subject in the bass in A flat major, paired with the counter-subject in the tenor. A codetta modulates unexpectedly to F minor, after which the tonal answer appears in the alto in E flat major without the counter-subject. The subject returns in the tenor in A flat major with the counter-subject in the alto, followed by another codetta that explores D flat major before reaffirming A flat. The final entry of the counter-exposition presents the subject in the treble with only the initial portion of the counter-subject in the bass.

The modulatory section initiates with the subject in the alto in F minor, accompanied by the full counter-subject in the treble. Episode II ensues, effecting a modulation from A flat through C minor to E flat minor; this episode features octave skips in the treble, fragmented subject entries in the bass, and a running alto line, later distributing these elements across all voices. The subject reappears in the tenor in E flat minor without the counter-subject, followed by a tonal answer in the treble in B flat minor with the counter-subject in the alto. The subject then enters in the bass in D flat major, supported by the counter-subject in the treble. A codetta modulates from D flat back to the tonic A flat major.

The recapitulatory section opens with the subject in the tenor in A flat major, now accompanied by an altered, more florid version of the counter-subject in the treble, wherein the original crotchets are subdivided into quavers and semiquavers. Immediately following, Stretto I
