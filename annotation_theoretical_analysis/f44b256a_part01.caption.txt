This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of C minor, concluding its initial statement before continuing with an extension that elaborates upon its thematic material. An episode follows in sequential form, beginning with a phrase in F minor that is subsequently transposed and slightly altered to E♭ major. The second subject then appears in E♭ major, the relative major of the tonic, establishing a clear tonal contrast. A closing passage derived motivically from a segment of the second subject modulates back toward the tonic key, culminating in a dominant seventh harmony that prepares for the return of the first subject. The first subject then reappears in its original key of C minor, reaffirming the tonic and completing the formal design of the exposition.
