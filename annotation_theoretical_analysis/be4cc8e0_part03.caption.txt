This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key without alteration, preserving its original thematic and harmonic identity. The subsequent bridge passage reappears in a slightly lengthened and modified version; within this transition, a descending sequence in the treble modulates through F major and D major before arriving at C major. The second subject is now presented in the tonic key, maintaining its bipartite structure: the first subsection exhibits its characteristic asymmetrical phrasing and textural interplay, while the second subsection continues with broken chord figuration, ultimately concluding with a perfect cadence in the tonic. The movement concludes with a coda that slightly extends the original codetta; notably, within this coda, descending melodic figures are immediately answered by responsive ascending figures, creating a dialogic contour absent in the exposition’s codetta. The entire recapitulation is followed by a double bar and repeat.
