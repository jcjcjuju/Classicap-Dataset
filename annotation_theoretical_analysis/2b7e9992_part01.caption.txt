This constitutes the exposition of a ternary or rounded binary form. The first period begins in the tonic key of F sharp minor, briefly tonicizing the dominant before concluding with a perfect cadence in the dominant minor key of C sharp. The second period commences in this dominant minor key and modulates to B minor, subsequently moving to the relative major of the original tonic—A major—where it is firmly established by a perfect cadence. The period then concludes with a half cadence in the dominant major key of C sharp, thereby reinforcing the dominant’s centrality while introducing modal inflection through the shift from minor to major. A short connecting passage in the bass part follows, functioning as a transitional link to the subsequent section.
