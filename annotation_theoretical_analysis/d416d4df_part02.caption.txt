This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with a thematic reminiscence of the first subject, immediately establishing continuity with the exposition while initiating tonal and motivic instability characteristic of developmental processes. After a brief continuation of this material, a distinct episode commences, set firmly in C major—a key distantly related to the tonic E major—and occupies a substantial portion of the development. This episode introduces new harmonic and contrapuntal implications through its modal and tonal contrast. The final portion of the development returns to motivic material derived from the first subject, now structured over a dominant pedal point, thereby generating harmonic tension and preparing for the eventual return of the tonic key in the recapitulation.
