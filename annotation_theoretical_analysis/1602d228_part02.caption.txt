This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is primarily based on motivic material derived from the first subject. It opens in D minor with a restatement of the preceding link’s dominant harmony, followed by a variation of this link that appears first in the bass and is then imitated in the treble, serving as a contrapuntal lead-in to the opening phrase of the first subject. This phrase is then presented in a series of sequentially curtailed repetitions across three tonal areas: initially in D minor, modulating at its close to C major; subsequently in C major, where it concludes on an inversion of the dominant ninth chord of A minor; and finally in A minor, with inversion of parts. Following this, a brief contrapuntal treatment of an inverted motivic figure ensues. The development culminates with a thrice-repeated half-cadence in A minor—the relative minor of the tonic—each half-cadence articulated by a dominant chord preceded by an augmented sixth chord. A chromatic run follows, functioning as a retransition that leads directly into the recapitulation.
