This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of C sharp minor, proceeding as in the exposition until a sequential passage beginning at the equivalent of Bar 433 modulates to E major/minor. The second subject follows, now transposed to E major—the mediant of the tonic—and, as in its initial presentation, modulates to its subdominant in the third phrase. Subsequently, the second subject theme undergoes further elaboration: it begins in E minor, modulates to F sharp minor, and culminates in an extended statement of the theme in C sharp major over a dominant pedal in the bass. A brief passage of double octaves in C sharp minor evokes the character of the first subject. The movement concludes with a coda in C sharp minor, featuring a perfect cadence and a final stretto in double octaves that again recalls the first subject, ultimately ending with a tierce de Picardie.
