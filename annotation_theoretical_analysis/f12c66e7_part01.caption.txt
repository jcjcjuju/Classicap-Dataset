This constitutes the exposition of a rondo form. It opens with the first subject in A♭ major, the tonic key, presented in an eight-bar phrase that concludes with a full close in the tonic. This thematic statement is immediately followed by a varied repetition of the same subject, transposed an octave higher. Subsequently, an episode begins in F minor, initiating a modulatory process that, by its fourth bar, effects a modulation to E♭ major—the dominant key—where it stabilizes. The exposition concludes with a restatement of the first subject in its original tonic key and unaltered form, without subsequent variation or transposition.
