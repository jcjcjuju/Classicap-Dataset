This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section commences with the first phrase of the first subject presented in G minor in the bass, immediately establishing a tonal and motivic transformation of the primary thematic material. This is followed by a passage of canonical imitation, wherein the subject is treated contrapuntally across voices. Throughout the entire development, the musical content remains exclusively derived from the first subject, with no introduction of new thematic material. The harmonic language and textural procedures serve to destabilize the tonic and explore remote tonal areas through sequential and imitative treatment of the subject’s initial phrase.
