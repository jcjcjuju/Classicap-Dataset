This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with an episode in B minor, presenting a melody that concludes with a half cadence. This melody is subsequently restated in an inverted and extended form, transposed to G major, where it again terminates with a half cadence. Following this, a second melodic idea emerges in G major, derived motivically from the latter portion of the initial episode melody. A transitional passage then ensues, initiating in a manner analogous to the prior transition and executing a series of modulations through E minor, D major, and A major before reestablishing D major as the tonic. The transition culminates with a brief dominant pedal on A, followed by a cadenza that prepares the return of the principal subject in the tonic key.
