This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage alternates motivically between material derived from the opening of the second subject and a fragment originating from the transition section. It commences in C minor and undergoes a series of modulations through G minor, B-flat minor, and F major, ultimately arriving at D minor, in which key the section concludes on dominant harmony. This cadential articulation on the dominant of the relative minor departs from the conventional Classical practice of terminating the development on the dominant of the tonic key. The texture features continual inversion and re-inversion of the contrapuntal parts throughout the latter portion of the section. Harmonically, the passage includes a Neapolitan sixth chord and employs the Italian augmented sixth chord on two occasions, contributing to its chromatic and tonally unstable character.
