This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The subject begins in the tonic key of A flat minor and undergoes a series of modulations: first to C flat major (the relative major) at the third phrase, then enharmonically to B minor, followed by a shift to D major, and subsequently to E flat major. The initial portion of the subject is then restated in an altered form, reharmonized to cadence conclusively in the tonic key of A flat minor.
