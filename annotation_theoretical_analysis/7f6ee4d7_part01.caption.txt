This constitutes the exposition’s first subject group in a sonata-form movement. The section presents a thematic statement in G minor, the tonic key, structured as two parallel four-bar sentences. The initial sentence concludes with a cadence in the relative major (B♭ major), while the subsequent sentence reaffirms the tonic by cadencing in G minor. The phrase structure exhibits clear periodic construction, with harmonic motion directed toward these respective cadential goals. Immediately following this thematic statement, a modulatory transition commences, effecting an enharmonic shift to establish E♭ major as the new tonal center.
