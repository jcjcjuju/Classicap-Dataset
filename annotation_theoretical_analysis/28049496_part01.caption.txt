This constitutes the exposition of a binary-form prelude. The first period begins immediately with Theme I in the tonic key of D sharp minor and modulates to the relative major, F sharp major, culminating in a perfect cadence in that key. The period then continues to conclude with a perfect cadence in the dominant minor, A sharp minor. The second period commences at the double bar with the simultaneous presentation of Themes I and II. It initiates on the dominant harmony and subsequently touches upon F sharp major, followed by a cadence in the subdominant minor, G sharp minor. A descending sequence then facilitates a return to the tonic minor, D sharp minor, reaffirming the home key through a perfect cadence.
