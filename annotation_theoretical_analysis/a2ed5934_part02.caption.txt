This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is principally based on motivic and harmonic material derived from the first subject, initiating with an immediate allusion to the opening gesture of the movement—specifically, the third inversion of the eleventh chord that characterizes the exposition’s primary theme. Throughout this section, the thematic content undergoes transformation and recontextualization within shifting harmonic landscapes, culminating in a cadential articulation on the harmony of F minor. The developmental process remains tightly focused on the first subject’s identity, with no explicit reference to the second subject or other secondary material from the exposition.
