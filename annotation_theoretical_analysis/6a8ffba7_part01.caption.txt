This constitutes the exposition of a binary or rounded binary form, articulated through three distinct thematic statements. The section opens with a sixteen-bar sentence in the tonic key, structured as an eight-bar antecedent phrase concluding on a half cadence, followed by a varied consequent phrase of equal length that culminates in a full cadence. This entire sixteen-bar unit is repeated. Subsequently, an eight-bar sentence in the dominant key (D major) presents a new theme derived motivically from the initial tonic sentence; this passage features sequential treatment in the melody during its first half and in both parts during its third and fourth bars. The exposition concludes with a restatement of the consequent phrase from the opening sentence—that is, the second eight bars of the original tonic sentence—now reaffirmed in the tonic key, and this final eight-bar unit is also repeated.
