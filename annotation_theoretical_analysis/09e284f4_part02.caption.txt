This constitutes the Trio section of a scherzo-trio-scherzo formal design. It opens with Theme 4 in A major, initiated through an enharmonic reinterpretation of the preceding D♭ tonic as C♯, functioning as the mediant of A major. The theme modulates to F♯ minor, concluding with an imperfect cadence followed by *delicatissimo* arpeggiation of the dominant chord. A restatement of Theme 4 follows, again beginning in A major before modulating to C♯ minor, where it ends with another imperfect cadence and dominant arpeggiation. Theme 5 (*espressivo*) then emerges in C♯ minor, subsequently modulating to F♯ minor via sequential treatment, before returning to C♯ minor; the final two bars shift enharmonically to E major. This is succeeded by Theme 6 (*leggiero*), entirely in E major, which incorporates the ii half-diminished seventh chord at two points. The entire preceding material is then repeated with minor ornamental alterations to Theme 4 and an added bar. Following this repeat, a development section ensues, beginning with a continuation of Theme 6 that modulates through A minor, F♯ major, and G major without establishing a stable tonal center. Theme 5 reappears next, subjected to further developmental treatment as it passes through G minor, C minor, and A♭ minor. Subsequently, Theme 2 from the Scherzo section returns in E major and is sequentially transposed through F♯ minor, G♯ minor, and ultimately B♭ minor. The Trio concludes with a final statement of Theme 5 (*sempre con fuoco*) in B♭ minor, featuring melodic alterations and persistent emphasis on the dominant harmony, which generates harmonic tension and anticipation for the reprise of the Scherzo’s opening material.
