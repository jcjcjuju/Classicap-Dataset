This constitutes the recapitulatory section and coda of a binary or rounded binary form. The first segment presents a restatement of the opening thematic material originally articulated in the tonic key of F major and its dominant, C major, now reproduced without internal repetitions. This restatement retains the eight-bar sentence structure and the characteristic motivic use of repeated C’s, which undergo imitation and recurrence as in the initial statement. The subsequent coda is derived from the first phrase of the episode, transposed into the major mode—specifically F major—thereby contrasting with its prior appearance in the minor mode during the episode. The coda concludes the movement with a perfect cadence in the tonic key, affirming tonal closure through thematic recall and modal resolution.
