This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage is exclusively based on motivic material derived from the first subject and makes no reference to the second subject. The treatment remains tightly focused on the thematic content introduced in the tonic key during the exposition, subjected here to developmental manipulation without the inclusion of contrasting thematic elements.
