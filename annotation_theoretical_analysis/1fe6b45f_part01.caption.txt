This constitutes the exposition, modulatory episodes, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in A minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the bass in the tonic key of A minor, followed by a tonal answer in the alto transposed to the dominant key of E minor, accompanied by a countersubject in the bass. A brief codetta modulates from A minor to C major, after which the subject reappears in the treble in the tonic key, now paired with the countersubject in the alto. The modulatory section comprises five episodes, each effecting a modulation and alternating with statements of the subject or tonal answer in new keys: Episode I modulates from A minor to C major, leading to a subject entry in the bass in C major with the countersubject in the treble; Episode II modulates from C major to E minor, preceding a tonal answer in the treble in E minor with the countersubject in the alto; Episode III modulates from E minor back to A minor, introducing a subject statement in the alto with the countersubject in the bass; Episode IV modulates from A minor to D minor, followed by a subject in the treble in D minor with the countersubject in the bass; and Episode V modulates from D minor back to A minor. The recapitulatory section presents the subject once more in the bass in the tonic key of A minor, but without the countersubject, and concludes with a coda in A minor that draws upon motivic material from the latter portion of both the subject and the countersubject.
