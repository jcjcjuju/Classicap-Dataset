This constitutes the development section of the movement. It presents a third subject derived motivically from the triplet accompaniment figure of the first subject. The thematic material unfolds through modulation between G major and E minor, establishing a tonal contrast with both the tonic key of E major and the dominant key of B major heard in the exposition. The developmental treatment exploits the rhythmic and textural characteristics of the original accompanimental figure, recontextualizing it as primary thematic content within a harmonically unstable and exploratory passage.
