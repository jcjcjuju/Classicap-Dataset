This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section is principally based on motivic material derived from the first subject. Within this developmental discourse, the second subject appears in a varied form, transposed to the key of D major. The harmonic trajectory culminates in a dominant seventh chord, which serves as a structural dominant preparation. This dominant seventh is immediately succeeded by a scale passage that overlaps with the subsequent re-entry of the first subject, thereby creating a seamless transition into the recapitulation.
