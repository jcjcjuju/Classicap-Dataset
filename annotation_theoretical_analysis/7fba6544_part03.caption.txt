This constitutes the final structural section of the movement, functioning as a modified recapitulatory and coda-like passage. It commences with a restatement of the first subject in the tonic key of E major, preserving its original thematic identity. This is followed by an episode that mirrors the material and construction of the initial episode but transposed into the key of A major. Subsequently, the second subject reappears not in the tonic but in A major, thereby deviating from conventional recapitulatory practice. A transitional passage derived from the second subject then modulates back to the tonic key. The section concludes with a varied restatement of the first subject in E major, which assumes the formal characteristics of a coda; this final iteration incorporates the motivic figure that underpins the episodic material, reaffirming its structural significance at the movement’s close.
