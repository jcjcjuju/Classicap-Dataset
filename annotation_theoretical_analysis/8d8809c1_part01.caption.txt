This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, comprises two four-bar phrases and concludes with a half-cadence in the tonic. A bridge-passage or transition follows, modulating to B flat major—the dominant key—and culminates in a half cadence; a half-bar’s link connects this to the second subject. The second subject unfolds in B flat major and is structured as an eight-bar sentence, which is subsequently restated in a varied form that is considerably extended through cadential repetitions. Within this extended statement, an interrupted cadence supplants the expected perfect cadence, thereby initiating the ensuing cadential repetitions that reinforce the dominant key before the exposition’s close. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
