This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The principal subject is presented in the tonic key as an eight-bar sentence concluding with a perfect cadence; this sentence is immediately restated with slight variations. A transition follows, initiated by a new melodic idea in the tonic. Its second two-bar unit engages in a free sequential relationship with the first, and a subsequent phrase begins with a comparable motivic gesture, transposed up by step, effecting an immediate modulation to F major—the dominant key—in which the transition concludes with a half-cadence. The second subject then unfolds in F major: its fore-phrase is constructed entirely from reiterated and subtly varied statements of its opening motive, while the after-phrase employs a form of augmentation at its cadential repetition, wherein the harmonic rhythm is halved such that a single bar’s two chords are each extended to occupy a full bar, thereby expanding the phrase. A brief link ensues, characterized by a sustained pedal tone simultaneously maintained in both treble and bass voices across its first three bars; this pedal, initially functioning as the tonic of F major, is reinterpreted by the end of the passage as the dominant of B-flat major, embedded within a dominant seventh chord. The exposition concludes with a full restatement of the principal subject in the tonic key.
