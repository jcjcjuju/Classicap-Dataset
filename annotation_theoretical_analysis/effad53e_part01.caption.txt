This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of B♭ major and exhibits an asymmetrical phrase structure: its initial phrase spans 3.25 bars and conveys rhythmic incompleteness, with analytical interpretations suggesting either that three silent beats at the outset would regularize it into a four-bar phrase or that the first three beats of the subsequent bar function as an overlap between the closing of the first phrase and the beginning of the second. The first subject concludes with a cadence on the dominant, though its precise endpoint is ambiguous and may occur as early as the ninth bar. A connecting episode follows, commencing with motivic material derived from the third and fourth bars of the first subject, initially remaining in the tonic before proceeding through two sequential bars that modulate toward a six-bar pedal point in C major. The second subject then unfolds in F major—the dominant key—and is articulated in three distinct portions. Its opening bar incorporates a transposed version (a fifth lower) of the transitional passage linking the connecting episode to the second subject. The first portion spans the initial eight bars of the second subject, followed by a second portion that extends over thirteen bars; however, this second portion is abruptly truncated by the onset of the third portion, which begins without cadential closure and thereby deprives the preceding phrase of its expected completion. The exposition concludes with a coda based on material from the second portion of the second subject, set above a pedal point. The entire exposition is marked for repetition.
