This constitutes the exposition of a prelude structured in four distinct periods. Period I establishes thematic material through the presentation of Theme I in the treble, followed by its reassignment to the bass beneath the emergence of Theme III in the upper voice; Theme IV appears shortly thereafter in the treble and serves episodically. The period concludes with a perfect cadence in the relative major, D. Period II continues with the juxtaposition of Themes I and II, which are braced together as at the opening, and introduces a variant of inverted Theme II elaborated with turns, presented above Theme I. This period modulates to and concludes with a perfect cadence in the dominant minor, F♯. Period III features sequential treatment of earlier material and culminates in a half cadence on the first inversion of the dominant ninth chord. Period IV returns to the tonic key of B, incorporating transposed segments of earlier episodic material—including the turn-ornamented figure now rendered in the tonic—and concludes with a perfect cadence in the tonic, thereby completing the tonal and thematic cycle of the exposition.
