This constitutes the introduction to the movement. It establishes the foundational motivic material for the entire work, most notably the three-note “Le-be-wohl” motif, which permeates subsequent sections in varied guises. The opening six-bar phrase is followed by a slightly altered and transposed restatement of the same material, creating a binary-like structure within the introduction itself. This initial presentation of the “Le-be-wohl” figure serves as the generative cell for thematic development throughout the exposition, development, recapitulation, and coda.
