This constitutes a brief linking passage that functions as a transition to the final section of the movement. The passage is based on a contraction of the earlier transition material, distilled to its harmonic essence: it features an Italian sixth chord resolving directly to the dominant chord in G major. This harmonic progression serves a modulatory and connective purpose, preparing the tonal shift necessary for the subsequent return of the second subject in the tonic key.
