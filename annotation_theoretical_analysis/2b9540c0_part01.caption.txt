This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject begins in the tonic key of B♭ major; its initial phrase establishes this tonality, while the subsequent portion commences with a literal repetition of the opening two-bar idea, now transposed to the tonic minor (B♭ minor). This passage then modulates to the dominant minor (F minor) and concludes with a full cadence featuring a Tierce de Picardie, thereby affirming F major at the cadence and eliminating the need for a distinct transitional passage. The second subject appears in the dominant key of F major and, consistent with conventions for slow movements, comprises a single thematic section. Although it briefly modulates to G minor, the subject remains predominantly in F major. Its first four-bar phrase culminates in a perfect cadence, though the effect of closure is attenuated by a retardation of the tonic chord. The following four bars present a repetition of this material, now extended to lead into an additional phrase that continues the thematic discourse through to the end of the subject. A one-bar codetta follows, constructed over a tonic pedal in F major. The exposition concludes with a brief link beginning on the second eighth note of the subsequent bar, articulated as a dominant seventh chord in the home key of B♭ major, which serves to prepare the return of the tonic and initiate the recapitulation.
