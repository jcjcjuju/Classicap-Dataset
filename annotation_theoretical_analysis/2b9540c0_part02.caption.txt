This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of B flat major, presented with slight elaboration through ornamental variation, consistent with conventions for slow movements in this form. No transitional passage intervenes before the second subject, which follows immediately and is also transposed to the tonic key, where it undergoes more extensive elaboration while retaining its essential thematic character. The section concludes with a codetta that reinforces the tonic through harmonic and textural closure.
