This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage is primarily centered on B flat, the dominant of the tonic key, and functions as a harmonic and motivic preparation for the return of the first subject. It initiates a modulation to E flat major, the tonic key, as early as the second bar of the section. With the exception of a brief deviation in two bars, the harmonic progression alternates consistently between tonic and dominant harmonies in the prevailing key. The entire passage is derived motivically from figures introduced in the second subject of the exposition, thereby maintaining thematic continuity while operating within a developmental harmonic framework.
