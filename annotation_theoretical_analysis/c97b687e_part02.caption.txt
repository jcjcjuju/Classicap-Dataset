This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. It commences with a recitative marked Largo, which is thematically derived from the opening two bars of the movement. This introductory gesture is followed by an Allegro passage that predominantly exhibits the same thematic character as the regular theme presented in the exposition’s connecting episode; this material itself is constructed from the same motivic cell originating in the initial Largo bars. The entire section thus unfolds as a motivic elaboration rooted in the primary thematic idea, maintaining continuity through transformation and recontextualization of the foundational figure.
