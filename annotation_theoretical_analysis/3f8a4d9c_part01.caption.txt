This constitutes the Scherzo section in Simple Binary form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of C major and concludes with a cadence in G major, the dominant. This material is followed by a development section that introduces a distinctive motivic figure—first appearing within this developmental passage—which later recurs in the Coda. The binary structure is completed by a restatement of the first subject, now transposed and altered to conclude firmly in the tonic key of C major. A brief Coda follows, derived from the aforementioned motivic figure introduced during the development. The entire second half of the binary form, encompassing the development, the tonic-return of the first subject, and the Coda, is repeated in full.
