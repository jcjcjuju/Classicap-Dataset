This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, comprises two sentences, each concluding with a full close in the tonic. Within this subject, the responsive phrase of the opening sentence and its cadential repetition occupy an eight-bar span that departs from symmetrical phrase structure: the initial statement is contracted to three bars, while its repetition is expanded to five bars through slight extensions at both the beginning and the close. The transition begins with two introductory bars in G minor, followed by a melodious four-bar phrase in E♭ major, which is immediately repeated and extended. This transitional passage modulates to F major—the dominant key—via C minor and B♭ major, with a brief detour through C major before arriving conclusively in F. The second subject, set in F major, is constructed from a combination of the first motive of the first subject and a second motive derived from the latter’s second motive; these motives, transposed into the dominant key, are now presented simultaneously rather than sequentially. The opening phrase of this subject is subsequently repeated on a diminished triad. The exposition concludes with a codetta consisting of a four-bar phrase that is cadentially repeated with slight modification and extension.
