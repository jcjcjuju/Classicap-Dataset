This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The first subject theme is reworked sequentially through F sharp minor, E major, and C sharp minor, preserving its characteristic dotted rhythms and quaver accompaniment while undergoing tonal transformation. This is followed by a passage featuring triplet figuration derived from the transition material, initially in C sharp minor and then modulating to D major; this passage functions harmonically to prepare the return of the tonic key, culminating in a German augmented sixth chord. The final portion of the development settles predominantly in A major, where the closing theme appears in imitative counterpoint between the hands, interspersed with fragmented motivic references to the first subject.
