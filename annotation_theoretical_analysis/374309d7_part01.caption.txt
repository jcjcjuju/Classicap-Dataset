This constitutes the exposition of a ternary-like thematic design articulated through four distinct periods. The first period establishes the tonic key through a tonic pedal sustained over its initial half, culminating in a perfect cadence in the dominant key. The second period modulates to the submediant, concluding with a perfect cadence in that key. The third period returns to the tonic, reaffirming it with a perfect cadence. The fourth period functions as a coda, featuring a dominant pedal in its latter portion, thereby reinforcing tonal closure. Throughout, the principal thematic material introduced at the outset undergoes textural inversion—most notably at the outset of the second period, where the treble and bass voices exchange roles—and appears in various contrapuntal guises across multiple voices, including sequential treatment and inversion, as detailed in the movement’s thematic inventory.
