This constitutes the episode of a sonata-rondo form. The episode begins with a section in the tonic key of B flat major, whose initial phrase unfolds over a tonic pedal and modulates to the dominant key of F major; within this phrase, a sequential passage traverses G minor and F major. This is followed by a modulatory passage that commences in C minor and proceeds through B flat minor before arriving at F major, the dominant; this passage derives its material from the principal motive of the preceding melody and incorporates a brief sequence. The opening phrase of the section then returns in a modified repetition, now adjusted to conclude firmly in the tonic key of B flat major. A brief link follows, constructed from a motive drawn from the principal subject. The episode continues with a second section in E flat major, the subdominant key, whose initial phrase modulates to B flat major, the dominant of that key. This phrase is succeeded by a modulating passage that develops figures from the prior phrase: it begins in the bass with an inversion of the repeated-note figure that opened the treble of the previous phrase, and culminates in Bars 51–52 with an inversion of Bars 47–48, including inverse movement of the treble intervals in Bar 51. The section concludes with a modified repetition of its opening phrase, now adjusted to close in E flat major. A final link ensues, initiated by a chromatic scale passage first introduced earlier in the movement; this passage appears first in the bass and is then imitated a seventh higher in the treble with inverted voice leading, before concluding with a restatement of material from the second part of the principal subject.
