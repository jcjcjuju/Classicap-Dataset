This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject, presented in the tonic key, comprises two complete sentences: the first is a melodic three-phrase structure of four bars each, while the second is a rhythmically distinctive eight-bar sentence extended to ten bars through cadential repetition; within this section, the melody is overlapped and restated in the bass. The subsequent bridge passage begins in D minor—the relative minor—and features a repeated phrase that modulates to C minor. This transition employs broken chord figuration, derived from earlier material, articulated over the first inversion of the C minor chord, then over the first inversion of the A-flat major chord, and finally over the German sixth chord in C minor, culminating in a half-cadence in that key. The second subject appears in the dominant major (C major) and is divided into two sections. The first section is a sixteen-bar sentence in four-bar periodic phrasing, with its second half presenting a varied repetition of the initial phrase, adjusted to conclude with a full cadence rather than a half cadence; notable are the double upward suspensions occurring at structural points within this section. The second section alternates between major and minor modes of the dominant key: it opens in C major with the melody assigned to the bass, then immediately reiterates its opening two-bar idea an octave lower in C minor; a sequential passage follows, effecting a brief modulation to E-flat major before returning to C minor for a reiterated half-cadence. The mode ultimately reverts to major with the onset of the concluding portion, which unfolds in two-bar periodicity and is subsequently restated an octave higher with extended cadential elaboration. The exposition closes with a codetta, after which the entire exposition is repeated.
