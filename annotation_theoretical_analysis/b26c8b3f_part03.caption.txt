This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, preserving its original thematic material and internal phrase structure, including the asymmetrical contraction and expansion observed in its initial presentation. The subsequent transitional passage reappears with significant modification, specifically reworked to effect a modulation that confirms the tonic key rather than preparing the dominant, thereby fulfilling the structural requirement of tonal resolution in the recapitulation. The second subject follows, now transposed to the tonic key, retaining its motivic derivation from the first subject and its characteristic contrapuntal combination of motives. The codetta concludes the section with a four-bar phrase that undergoes cadential repetition, slightly modified and extended, reaffirming the tonic through a conclusive cadence. The entire recapitulation is marked for repetition.
