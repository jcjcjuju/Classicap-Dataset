This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key and comprises an eight-bar sentence featuring a full close in the tonic; this sentence is immediately followed by a varied repetition. Structurally, the sentence divides into two four-bar phrases, each further subdivided into two-bar segments. The second phrase begins as a sequential transposition of the first, initiating on the chord of E minor and effecting a transient modulation to that key. The transition section derives its material from semiquaver (sixteenth note) figures originating in the first subject. While largely remaining in the tonic key, it modulates to the dominant key by its conclusion. The second subject appears in the dominant key (A major) and is divided into two sections. The first section (Bars 27–41) is based on the opening motive of the first subject, transposed into the dominant, and rendered with close canonic imitation at the octave below between the upper and lower parts, with the lower voice entering at a distance of one quaver (eighth note). The second section (Bars 41–53) presents a twelve-bar melody composed of three phrases of unequal length—four, five, and three bars respectively—with the second phrase constituting a modified repetition of the first. A brief codetta follows, constructed from previously stated motivic material, and the exposition concludes with a double bar and repeat.
