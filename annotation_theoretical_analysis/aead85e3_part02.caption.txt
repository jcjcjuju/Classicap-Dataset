This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The entire section is characterized by the persistent reiteration of the initial four-note rhythmic figure first introduced in the first subject. This motivic cell serves as the primary developmental material, undergoing continuous repetition and rhythmic propulsion throughout the section, thereby unifying the harmonic and textural activity of the development.
