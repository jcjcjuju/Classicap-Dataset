This constitutes the exposition, counter-exposition, modulatory section, recapitulatory section, and coda of a tonal fugue in G sharp minor. The exposition presents the subject in the tenor in the tonic key, followed by a tonal answer in the alto in D sharp minor with a countersubject in the tenor; the subject then appears in the treble in the tonic with a countersubject in the alto, and the answer enters in the bass in D sharp minor with a countersubject in the treble. This is followed by Episode I, which modulates from G sharp minor to D sharp minor and concludes with a cadence. The counter-exposition begins with an answer in the tenor in D sharp minor accompanied by a countersubject in the treble, then proceeds to Episode II, which modulates from G sharp minor to C sharp minor and closes. A real answer—exceptional in this tonal fugue—appears in the bass in G sharp minor with a countersubject in the alto, followed by a statement of the subject in the tenor in the tonic without a countersubject, and an answer in the alto in D sharp minor with a countersubject in the tenor.

The modulatory section commences with Episode III, which modulates from G sharp minor to D sharp minor, followed by a statement of the subject in the treble in D sharp minor without a countersubject, and an answer in the bass in F sharp minor also lacking a countersubject. Episode IV then modulates from B major to G sharp minor and closes. The recapitulatory section opens with the subject in the tenor in G sharp minor accompanied by a countersubject in the alto, followed by Episode V, which modulates from D sharp minor to C sharp minor. The final answer appears in the treble in D sharp minor with a reminiscence of the countersubject in the alto, leading into a coda in G sharp minor.
