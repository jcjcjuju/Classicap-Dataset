This constitutes the recapitulatory section and coda of a binary or rounded binary form. The first sixteen bars present a restatement of the initial tonic-key sentence, comprising an eight-bar phrase ending on a half cadence followed by a varied repetition of the same phrase concluding with a full cadence in the tonic. This is succeeded by a coda that features a transient modulation to the subdominant key, articulated through harmonic progressions in two distinct passages. Within this coda, a chord is interpreted as an inversion of the supertonic minor ninth in the subdominant key but is resolved as an inversion of the dominant minor ninth in G major. This leads to a diminished seventh chord built on the raised fourth scale degree of G major, which resolves to the second inversion of the tonic triad, thereby reinforcing the home key through a plagal-like cadential motion.
