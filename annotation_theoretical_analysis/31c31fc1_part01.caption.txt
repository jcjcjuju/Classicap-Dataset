This constitutes the exposition of a binary-form prelude. The first period establishes the tonic key of E minor and modulates to its relative major, C major, which is sustained through a sequential passage that briefly rearticulates E minor and C major before introducing an A minor inflection. The harmonic trajectory then initiates a gradual return to the tonic, culminating in a perfect cadence in E minor. An episodic transition follows, effecting a modulation to the subdominant key, A minor. The second period, marked by a shift to Presto tempo, begins in this subdominant region and subsequently explores A minor and C major through a brief sequential gesture before reestablishing the tonic key of E minor as its ultimate harmonic goal.
