This constitutes a transitional episode functioning as the second part of the movement’s large-scale design. The section begins with a four-bar phrase in C major, which is immediately restated at the interval of a perfect fourth higher, thereby transposing the material to F major. This eight-bar unit is then subjected to a varied repetition, extending over a further eight bars and maintaining the tonal framework established by the initial statements. The entire episode thus unfolds as a sequence-based construction, characterized by motivic consistency and harmonic motion through related keys. It is followed by a six-bar modulatory passage that serves a clear formal function: to prepare the return of the first subject by reestablishing the tonic key of G major through dominant prolongation and voice-leading directed toward the subsequent thematic reentry.
