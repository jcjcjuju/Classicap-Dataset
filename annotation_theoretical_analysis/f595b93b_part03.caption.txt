This constitutes a developmental reprise section characterized by fragmentation, tonal instability, and textural transformation of previously introduced thematic material. The opening theme returns in a compressed and unsettled form, merging its first two phrases into a single gesture that remains incomplete, followed by silence. This is succeeded by a passage in A minor closely modeled on an earlier cadential phrase, leading into a rearticulation of the closing material—now destabilized by a cadence interrupted with a diminished seventh chord (A–C–E♭–G♭). A variation of the earlier “B” subsection follows, transposed to D♭ major, featuring canonic imitation between soprano and tenor voices over a dominant pedal; diminished seventh harmony in the following bars facilitates a modulation to G♭ major. The closing passage undergoes further transformation, intensified through heightened dynamics, increased tempo, greater textural density, and pervasive use of the dotted quaver–semiquaver–quaver rhythmic motif. A transformed statement of the opening theme appears in B♭ major—inflected with suggestions of G minor—and concludes abruptly on an inversion of the dominant seventh of E. The theme then reemerges in the tenor voice in E major, subsequently migrating to the bass in C major. A transposed variation of the “B” subsection ensues, now in C major, progressing via diminished seventh harmony to F major over a dominant pedal, yet pointedly avoiding tonal closure in the tonic. The closing passage recurs once more, transposed down a semitone and retaining its diminished seventh harmonic framework. A final transformation of the opening theme unfolds in G minor, shifting to D minor, with a chromatically descending bass line that leads directly into a return of the Presto con fuoco theme—first in D minor, then in A minor—followed by a continuation in A minor that sustains dominant pedal activity without actual dominant chord resolution.
