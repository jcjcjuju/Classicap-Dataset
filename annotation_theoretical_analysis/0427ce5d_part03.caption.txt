This constitutes a self-contained episode functioning as a contrasting middle section within the movement’s larger ternary design. The passage opens with an increase in rhythmic activity through the introduction of semiquaver motion, establishing A flat major as the tonic. It modulates to E flat major—the dominant—and subsequently returns to A flat major, with harmonic color enriched throughout by appoggiaturas. The harmonic language then shifts to emphasize tonic and dominant seventh harmonies in A flat major before moving to D flat major (the subdominant), where dominant seventh sonorities reinforce the new tonal center. A return to A flat major follows, culminating in an imperfect cadence that creates a sense of suspension. The final portion reaffirms A flat major, incorporating secondary seventh chords—specifically the chord F–A natural–C–E flat, functioning as a secondary dominant of the supertonic—before resolving decisively with a perfect cadence.
