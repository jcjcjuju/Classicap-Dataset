This constitutes the first section of a simple binary form. It opens with a first subject in the tonic key of F minor, which concludes with a cadence in A-flat major. This initial phrase is followed by a sequential passage that develops motivic material through sequence. The first subject then returns in its original key, now modified to achieve a conclusive cadence in the tonic F minor. The section closes with a coda that reinforces the tonic key. The entire span from the sequential passage onward is repeated, with the repeat commencing at the sequential material rather than the opening phrase.
