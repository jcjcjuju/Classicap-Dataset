This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, presented without alteration from its initial appearance. It is followed by a transition that remains unaltered in content, preserving its original scalar and sequential character. The second subject then reappears, now transposed to the tonic key, with all internal features—including its thematic material, sectional repetitions, and cadential prolongations—retained exactly as in the exposition, save for the change of key. The movement concludes this section with a codetta that mirrors the structure and harmonic behavior of its earlier counterpart, now firmly grounded in the tonic.
