This constitutes a large-scale formal section encompassing thematic restatement, tonal transformation, and developmental interlude, ultimately leading to a return of the second theme in its original key. It begins with a transposed statement of the first theme in A minor, underpinned by a dominant pedal in the bass. The melody repeatedly ascends to the leading tone, only to be deflected back to the submediant, creating a sense of unresolved aspiration; this harmonic frustration is intensified by the pervasive use of diminished seventh harmony. A stark tonal and expressive contrast follows with the second theme, now presented in A major—a tritone transposition from its original E-flat major. This restatement is characterized by a robust chordal texture, florid embellishment, and an exuberant character, its initial dominant seventh–tonic progression providing a clear resolution to the preceding tension. The theme’s conclusion is extended, culminating in a fortississimo diminished seventh chord. An interlude ensues, commencing with twelve bars grounded on the dominant minor ninth chord of E-flat major, featuring continuous eighth-note motion in the right hand occasionally articulated in hemiola rhythm. A scherzando passage then emerges as a transformed version of earlier interlude material, unfolding in E-flat major with tonic and dominant seventh harmonies. This gives way to rising sequential patterns, followed by an abrupt modulation to F-sharp minor and a semitone-descending bass line that resolves to a second-inversion tonic chord of E-flat major. The key is firmly reestablished through dominant–tonic progressions, momentarily colored by a shift to E-flat minor. The section concludes with a full restatement of both parts of the second theme in the original key of E-flat major, now rendered with greater dynamic force and assertive character, before a brief return to G minor in the final bars of the passage.
