This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section engages motivic material from both the first and second subjects of the exposition. The first subject, initially presented in a two-bar periodic structure in the tonic key of F minor during the exposition, reappears here in a transformed rhythmic organization, recast into a three-bar phrase structure. This developmental treatment alters the original metric symmetry, thereby destabilizing the thematic profile and enhancing the section’s harmonic and rhythmic instability. A prolonged pedal point ensues, functioning as a dominant preparation that spans a significant duration and ultimately facilitates the structural return to the tonic key at the onset of the recapitulation.
