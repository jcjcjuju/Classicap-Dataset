This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. It begins with the first subject restated in the tonic key. This is followed by an unaltered, overlapping bridge-passage or transition that leads into the second subject. The recapitulation of the second subject exhibits an irregular tonal plan: it commences in the dominant key (G major), deviating from the conventional return in the tonic, and only modulates to the tonic key (C major) at the conclusion of its first phrase. Thereafter, the remaining portions of the second subject are presented in the tonic key, albeit with slight modifications. Structurally, the second subject retains its tripartite division as heard in the exposition. The section concludes with a coda, which begins in earnest over a tonic pedal point and incorporates material derived from the opening of the development section; this coda features harmonic suggestions of the plagal cadence. A repeat of the entire recapitulation section is indicated.
