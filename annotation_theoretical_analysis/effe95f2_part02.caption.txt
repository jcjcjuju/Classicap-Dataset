This constitutes the first variation of a theme-and-variations movement. The variation preserves the formal structure of the original Air, including its bipartite design with the first section concluding on the dominant and the second section closing firmly on the tonic. The principal transformation lies in the melodic elaboration, as the variation’s interest is almost exclusively concentrated in the upper voice, which ornaments or reconfigures the original thematic material while leaving the harmonic and structural framework largely intact.
