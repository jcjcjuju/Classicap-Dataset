This constitutes the exposition, modulatory section, and recapitulatory section of a tonal fugue in B flat major. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the alto in the tonic key, followed by a tonal answer in the treble in the dominant (F major), without a counter-subject. A codetta modulates from F major back to B flat major, after which the subject reappears in the bass in the tonic. Episode I then modulates from B flat to F major, leading to a real answer in the bass in F major. Episode II continues the modulation from B flat to F, followed by another real answer in the alto in F major. Episode III modulates from F major back to B flat, preceding a final statement of the subject in the treble in the tonic. The modulatory section commences with Episode IV, which modulates from F major to G minor, setting up a subject entry in the bass in G minor. Episode V modulates from G minor to E flat major, where the subject appears in the alto. Episode VI modulates from E flat major to C minor, followed by a subject statement in the treble in C minor. Episode VII then modulates from C minor through G minor back to B flat major. The recapitulatory section presents a slightly altered tonal answer in the treble in B flat major, followed by a coda in the tonic that synthesizes material from the opening of the subject and two auxiliary contrapuntal themes introduced earlier, with its closing bars derived from a transposition of dominant-key material into the tonic.
