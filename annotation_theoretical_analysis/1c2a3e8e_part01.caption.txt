This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key of A major; aside from a brief dominant passage, it remains firmly rooted in the tonic and concludes with a full close. A connecting episode follows, commencing in the tonic key with a two-bar bass passage that is immediately restated a twelfth higher in the treble, then reappears in the bass a third above its original pitch. This episode modulates through the dominant major key to the dominant minor, ultimately arriving in E minor at its conclusion. The second subject unfolds through a series of modulatory phrases: it initiates in E minor with a four-bar phrase concluding in G major, which is then transposed and repeated in G major ending in B♭ major, followed by another iteration in B♭ major ending in D major; after further sequential treatment, it finally settles in E major, closing with a four-bar phrase that is subsequently repeated with the first two bars of the phrase inverted. The exposition concludes with a coda derived from previously stated material.
