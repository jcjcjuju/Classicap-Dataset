This constitutes the transition and second subject of a sonata-form exposition. A brief connecting episode initiates modulation away from the tonic key, leading to the second subject in C major. The thematic material of this second subject is partially derived from the opening gesture of the first subject, specifically its second and third bars, though now presented in the new key. The section concludes with a direct modulation back to the tonic key at its final bar, bypassing an independent development section and preparing for the subsequent return of the first subject.
