This constitutes a fugal variation based on the original Air. The subject, derived from the thematic material of the Air, is introduced in common time and immediately answered at the second above in a two-bar canon, accompanied by an independent bass line. Throughout the section, the subject undergoes diverse contrapuntal treatments while preserving the fugal texture and stylistic integrity. The imitative procedures and continuous development of the subject ensure that the fugal character remains consistent across the entire span of the variation.
