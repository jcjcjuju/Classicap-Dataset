This constitutes the second subject group and subsequent transitional passage of a sonata-form movement. The section opens with a thematic passage in B flat minor that modulates to D flat major; this passage is immediately repeated with inverted voice leading. The same thematic material then reappears with its tonal trajectory reversed, now commencing in D flat major and concluding in B flat minor, followed by a further repetition of this iteration with the parts again inverted. A two-bar prolongation in B flat minor ensues, after which the tempo shifts to Presto and a new thematic subject is introduced, initiating in B flat minor and modulating to F major. This Presto subject is subsequently restated in a varied form, now beginning in F major and returning to B flat minor. The section concludes with a transitional passage derived motivically from the Presto subject, which functions to prepare the return of the first subject group.
