This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section commences in G minor with motivic material derived from the opening bar of the first subject, combined contrapuntally with the semiquaver (sixteenth note) figure originating from the second section of the second subject. The harmonic trajectory modulates sequentially through D minor and C major before arriving at A minor, the latter approached via a Neapolitan sixth chord. A short modulating sequence follows, likely inspired by the descending scalar figures from the exposition’s second subject, traversing A minor and G minor en route to F major; within this sequence, each recurrence of the semiquaver figuration features invertible counterpoint, with the parts exchanged between iterations. The subsequent passage evokes the character and material of the transition, leading into a dominant pedal on G—the dominant of the tonic key—elaborated through a variation of the first subject’s initial motive. This culminates in a scale passage that functions as a retransition, preparing the return of the first subject in the tonic at the onset of the recapitulation.
