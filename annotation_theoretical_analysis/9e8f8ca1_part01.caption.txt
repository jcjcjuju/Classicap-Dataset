This constitutes the exposition of a binary or modified binary form, comprising four distinct thematic periods that outline a tonal trajectory from tonic stability through modulatory exploration toward eventual return. Period I establishes the tonic key through a pedal point and concludes with a perfect cadence in the tonic. Period II initiates a process of tonal departure, traversing G major, D minor, and A minor before culminating in a perfect cadence in D minor, which is prolonged into the subsequent measure. Period III commences in D minor and continues the harmonic instability, briefly visiting G minor, D minor, and A minor before resolving to a perfect cadence in the subdominant major (F). Period IV effects a tonal return by reworking earlier material transposed to the subdominant level, referencing G major, D minor, and G minor before ultimately reestablishing the tonic key through a full close; this is followed by a coda grounded on a tonic pedal that reinforces tonal closure with a final perfect cadence in the tonic. Throughout these periods, a characteristic motivic figure—comprising an initial three-note cell derived from the prelude’s opening semiquavers followed by a four-note arpeggiated extension—is deployed imitatively across voices, often divided between parts or subjected to contrary motion, serving as a unifying contrapuntal device.
