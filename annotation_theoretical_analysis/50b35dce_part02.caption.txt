This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage is almost entirely derived from motivic fragments of the second subject. It begins with thematic material treated in the key of E flat major, which persists through a substantial portion of the section. This is followed by a transient modulation to C minor, initiating a harmonic trajectory that ultimately leads back to the tonic key of G minor. The development concludes with a dominant seventh harmony in the tonic key; this cadential dominant is inflected by a chromatic ascent in the bass, wherein C natural rises to C sharp and then to D, creating a heightened sense of tension and directional pull toward the imminent recapitulation.
