This constitutes the recapitulation of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key, presented with florid ornamentation, consistent with conventional practice in slow movements of sonata form. The transition follows, similarly adorned with elaborate ornamentation, maintaining its structural role while enriching the melodic texture. The second subject then appears transposed to the tonic key rather than the dominant, as in the exposition, and is presented in a varied form; it comprises two sentences, the first extending from the initial phrase to its consequent, and the second prolonging the cadential motion through repetition and elaboration. A double bar indicates a repeat of the entire recapitulation section. The movement concludes with a one-bar coda that provides a final cadential closure in the tonic.
