This constitutes the first section of a ternary form. It opens with a sentence structure in B♭ major, the tonic key, which modulates to F major, the dominant. This initial phrase spans an eight-bar framework extended to twelve bars through repetitions in its second phrase; the first phrase concludes with an inverted cadence in the tonic, while the second achieves a perfect cadence in the dominant. A six-bar transitional passage follows, beginning chromatically and effecting a modulation back to B♭ major, where it culminates in a half-cadence. The section concludes with a restatement of the opening sentence, now transposed entirely into the tonic key. In this final phrase, the opening idea undergoes inversion, and the consequent phrase is slightly expanded and altered to secure a cadence in the tonic rather than the dominant.
