This constitutes the third variation of a theme-and-variations movement. The variation is characterized by a metrical shift from the original 3/4 time to 2/4. It features extensive use of double counterpoint, with systematic inversion of thematic material: the passage corresponding to the first four bars of the variation is inverted—with minor alterations—in the following four bars; similarly, the material analogous to bars 9–12 undergoes inversion in bars 13–16, and the section equivalent to bars 17–24 is inverted in the final eight bars of the variation. This structural symmetry and contrapuntal treatment define the variation’s formal and textural organization.
