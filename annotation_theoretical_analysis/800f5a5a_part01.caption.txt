This constitutes the exposition of a binary form with incipient sonata-form tendencies. Period I establishes the tonic minor key of G sharp and concludes with a perfect cadence in the dominant major, D sharp. It is constructed from two primary thematic ideas: Theme I, introduced in the opening two bars and divisible into two contrasting one-bar segments, and Theme II, first appearing in the upper voice at the eighth bar, itself subdivided into two distinct gestures. The texture features contrapuntal interplay, including inversion of the upper voices over a consistent bass at the fourth bar and sequential treatment of a detached motivic figure from bars five through eight. Theme II’s presentation is accompanied by a bass line whose initial five notes derive from Theme I, and both voices proceed in descending sequence. Internal cadential articulations occur at the dominant minor (D sharp) and at the supertonic major (A sharp), the latter functioning as the dominant of the dominant. Period II begins with a transposition of the opening thematic material into the dominant major (D sharp), now accompanied by a newly assigned characteristic bass figure. Sequential development continues until a subtle alteration in the upper voice enables further sequential extension. A passage from bars 36–39 presents a transposition a fifth higher of the earlier Theme II statement, rendered in double counterpoint. The period culminates in a half cadence on the dominant, preparing the return of the opening subject. This return, slightly varied for textural interest, initiates a recapitulatory gesture that leads to a perfect cadence in the tonic minor, G sharp, with the closing phrase mirroring the cadential structure of Period I but now transposed to the tonic key. Throughout, the harmonic language exhibits fluid modulation and developmental treatment of motives, suggesting an expansion beyond strict binary form toward the developmental procedures characteristic of the modern sonata.
