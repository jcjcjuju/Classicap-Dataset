This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens with a developmental treatment of the final two bars of the exposition’s coda. This is followed by an episode in which a four-bar phrase is first presented and then transposed into G minor; the same four-bar unit undergoes a further transposition into B flat major. The development continues with a reworking of the coda’s closing material, now articulated in both B flat major and B flat minor, interwoven with episodic modulatory passages that ultimately arrive at the dominant chord of D major, preparing the tonal return in the subsequent recapitulation.
