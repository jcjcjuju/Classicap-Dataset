This constitutes the exposition, development, and recapitulation of a ternary form, functioning as the Trio section of the movement. The first subject is presented in F major (the tonic of this section), spanning an eleven-bar phrase that concludes with a cadence in C major (the dominant). Throughout this presentation, voice-leading is characterized by frequent invertible counterpoint, notably between the bass in bars 6–8 and the treble in bars 2–4. A development section follows, which thematically derives from the first subject and continues the practice of part inversion, as evidenced by the relationship between bars 17–19 and bars 13–15. The recapitulation then restates the first subject, now slightly shortened and modified to conclude firmly in the tonic key of F major rather than modulating to the dominant, thereby achieving tonal closure within this section. The entire structure is framed by repeat signs, enclosing a self-contained formal unit.
