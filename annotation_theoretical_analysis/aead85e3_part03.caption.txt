This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata-form movement. It opens with a curtailed statement of the first subject in the tonic key of D minor, retaining the foundational four-note motive that underpins the entire movement. The subsequent connecting episode begins by quoting material from the concluding portion of the original first subject and proceeds to modulate to B♭ major; within this episode, the initial rhythmic figure appears in the bass in B♭ minor, and the passage thereafter mirrors the structure of the exposition’s connecting episode while incorporating harmonic extensions, ultimately arriving on a dominant chord. The second subject follows, now transposed into the tonic key of D minor rather than the dominant minor heard in the exposition, with only minor melodic alterations. The movement concludes with an extended coda featuring a dominant pedal point initiated in the bass and later reinforced in the treble, over which the first subject returns in its complete form. A chromatic scale passage leads to a final emphatic perfect cadence articulated through the persistent rhythmic contour of the opening four-note figure.
