This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The section opens in G minor with material derived from the introductory phrase of the movement, specifically the first two bars of the introduction; the second of these bars is immediately repeated. This motivic reference establishes a cyclic integration of the introduction into the developmental process. The passage culminates in an enharmonic modulation, wherein E flat is reinterpreted as D sharp, effecting a pivot to the key of E minor. Subsequently, the introduction is again alluded to through distinct motivic figures appearing in two brief segments, which directly quote or closely paraphrase the introductory material. These references confirm the thematic unity between the introduction and the developmental discourse, as the same foundational figure underpins both the opening of the movement and its central developmental section.
