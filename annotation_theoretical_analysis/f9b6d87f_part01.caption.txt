This constitutes the exposition and subsequent modulatory episodes of a real fugue in A major. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the bass in the tonic key of A major, followed by a real answer in the alto in the dominant key of E major, without a countersubject. A codetta modulates from E major back to A major, leading to a restatement of the subject in the treble in the tonic. Another codetta then modulates from A major to E major, followed by the answer in the bass in E major. The modulatory section commences with a codetta effecting a modulation from A major to F♯ minor, where the subject appears in the treble. A further codetta modulates from F♯ minor to C♯ minor, setting up the answer in the alto in that key. Episode I follows, modulating from C♯ minor back to A major, and includes motivic suggestions of the subject in the upper voices over an independent bass line. The subject then reappears slightly altered in the bass in A major. Episode II ensues, modulating from A major through B minor and returning to A major, featuring subject-related material in the bass—including a passage in contrary motion at one point—while the upper parts engage in free imitation of a figure similar in character to that used in the bass of Episode I. The subject next appears in the treble in D major, followed by Episode III, which modulates from D major through A major to E major and distributes subject-derived material among all voices. A slightly altered answer appears in the alto in E major, succeeded by Episode IV, which modulates from E major back to A major and employs both similar and contrary motion in its treatment of the episodic figure.
