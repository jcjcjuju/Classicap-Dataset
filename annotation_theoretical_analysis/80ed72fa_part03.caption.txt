This constitutes the recapitulation section of a sonata form. The first subject returns in the tonic key of F minor, accompanied throughout by a pedal point: initially on the dominant (C), then shifting to D♭, and finally returning to the dominant. The connecting episode follows, beginning identically to its initial appearance in the exposition but subsequently extended by four bars before being transposed to conclude in F major—the tonic major. The second subject then enters in F major, with its first part presented in this key; the second part of the subject modulates to and concludes in the tonic minor (F minor). A coda ensues, significantly expanded and constructed from previously stated material. Within this coda, the second subject reappears twice: first in D♭ major and later in F minor. The movement concludes with six bars of unambiguous tonic harmony in F minor.
