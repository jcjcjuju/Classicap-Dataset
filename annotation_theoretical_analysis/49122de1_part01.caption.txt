This constitutes the exposition and subsequent modulatory and recapitulatory sections of a tonal fugue in G minor. The exposition begins with the subject presented in the tenor in the tonic key of G minor, followed by a tonal answer in the alto in D minor, accompanied by the counter-subject in the tenor. The subject then reappears in the treble in G minor with the counter-subject in the alto, and is succeeded by an answer in the bass in D minor with the counter-subject in the treble. This is followed by Episode I, which modulates from D minor back to G minor. A further statement of the subject occurs in the tenor in G minor, now accompanied by the counter-subject in the bass. The modulatory section commences with Episode II, effecting a modulation from G minor to D minor, after which the subject enters in the alto in D minor with the counter-subject in the treble. The tonal trajectory continues with the subject in the treble in B-flat major, paired with the counter-subject in the alto, followed by an answer in the bass in F major with the counter-subject in the treble. Episode III modulates from F major to B-flat major, leading to a double entry of the subject in thirds in the alto and tenor in B-flat major, with the counter-subject in the bass.

Episode V modulates from C minor to E-flat major, preceding a richly textured presentation of the subject in thirds in the tenor and bass in E-flat major, simultaneously combined with the counter-subject in thirds in the treble and alto.

The recapitulatory section begins with the subject in the tenor in G minor accompanied by the counter-subject in the alto, followed by a double entry of the subject in the treble and tenor with the counter-subject in the alto and bass, all in G minor. A codetta then establishes a perfect cadence in G minor, leading into a coda that remains in the tonic. Within the coda, the subject—slightly altered—appears in the bass, while the tenor and alto present a reminiscence of the
