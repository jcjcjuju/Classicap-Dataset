This constitutes a restatement of the first theme in the tonic key of G minor, functioning as a final thematic return prior to the coda. The passage is underpinned by a dominant pedal in the bass, which sustains harmonic tension throughout. The thematic material is presented with the same melodic contour as its earlier appearance in A minor, now transposed to G minor, retaining its characteristic stepwise ascent toward the leading tone. This ascent is repeatedly thwarted, as the melodic line is deflected back to the submediant scale degree rather than resolving to the tonic, a gesture intensified by the pervasive use of diminished seventh harmonies that amplify the sense of unresolved dissonance. The harmonic instability is ultimately resolved through a conclusive dominant seventh to tonic cadence, reaffirming G minor with structural finality.
