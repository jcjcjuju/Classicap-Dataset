This constitutes a recapitulatory statement of the first subject, presented in the tonic key of A flat major with variation, followed by a cadenza that functions as a transitional passage into the subsequent movement. The thematic material retains its essential identity from the initial presentation but is altered through embellishment or textural modification, while remaining firmly rooted in the tonic key. The cadenza that ensues departs from strict thematic or harmonic continuity, adopting a more improvisatory character and serving a connective formal role rather than concluding the movement with a structural cadence.
