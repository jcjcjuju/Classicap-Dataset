This constitutes the second part of a binary form. It begins with an eight-bar sentence in F minor, the tonic key, which modulates to A♭ major, its relative major. A notable feature is the resemblance between the final cadence of this section and the closing gestures of both phrases in the preceding part. This initial section is followed by an eight-bar sentence that modulates back to F minor. The part concludes with a four-bar phrase that restates the opening idea of Part II over a tonic pedal in F minor, slightly altered in its presentation, and culminates in a perfect cadence in the tonic key.
