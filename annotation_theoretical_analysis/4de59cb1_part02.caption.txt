This constitutes the second episode of the movement, functioning as a contrasting middle section that explores remote tonal areas before returning to the tonic. The episode begins in A flat major—the subdominant of the movement’s tonic key of E flat major—with a lyrical melody that subsequently modulates. The initial portion concludes with an inverted cadence in B flat major. The following section commences in G major and presents a restatement of the opening melodic material from the A flat major segment, now transposed. This is succeeded by a modulating sequential passage that traverses A flat minor, B flat minor, and C minor, ultimately arriving at a half-cadence. The episode concludes with a two-bar transitional passage that modulates back to the tonic key of E flat major, preparing for the subsequent return of the principal subject.
