This constitutes the initial large-scale formal section (A) of a scherzo, presenting a multi-thematic exposition followed by its literal repetition with minor alterations. The section opens with Theme 1 in B♭ minor, which modulates to its relative major, D♭ major, before an abrupt return to the tonic minor and an implied interrupted cadence articulated through bass notes alone. A striking sonority—an inversion of the ii half-diminished seventh chord—figures prominently early in the theme. Theme 1 is then restated, beginning identically in B♭ minor but diverging in its modulation to F minor (the dominant) rather than to D♭ major. This is followed by Theme 2, which remains firmly in D♭ major and incorporates the flattened sixth degree (B𝄫), deployed either within a dominant minor ninth chord or as part of chromatic scalar motion. Theme 3 ("con anima") commences in G♭ major and proceeds through a sequential modulation to A♭ major before arriving in D♭ major; this passage is characterized by expressive suspensions and appoggiaturas and features a recurring diminished seventh chord (F–A♭–C♭–D). A dominant pedal underpins the final bars of this theme, culminating in a perfect cadence. The section concludes with a closing theme consisting of tonic and dominant seventh arpeggios in D♭ major. The entire exposition is then repeated with only minor rhythmic adjustments to Theme 1.
