This constitutes the exposition of a sonata form. The first subject is presented in the tonic key and structured as an eight-bar sentence extended to nine bars through a sequential repetition of a motive in its second phrase; the first phrase unfolds entirely over a tonic pedal, which continues into the opening of the second phrase. An overlapping bridge passage follows, initially mimicking a restatement of the first subject before modulating to F major, briefly touching upon D major and C major, and ultimately arriving at a half-cadence in C minor—the tonic minor of the relative major key in which the second subject will appear. The second subject is presented in the relative major and divided into two sections: the first features a melodic sequence in its opening and a subsequent sequence involving all voices, while the second section includes a repetition of its melody with the majority of the material inverted. The exposition concludes with a codetta whose treble figures derive from the opening bar of the movement and whose bass draws upon a motive from the transition.
