This constitutes the second part of a binary-form movement, functioning as a contrasting middle section. It presents the first subject transposed to B major, structured in two four-bar phrases that together form an eight-bar period; this period concludes not in its initial key but with a cadence in D major. The entire eight-bar unit is then repeated, but with the internal phrase order inverted: the second four-bar phrase precedes the first, and this reordered version is itself stated twice in succession. The section is framed by a double bar with repeat signs, indicating performance repetition of the entire twenty-four-bar span.
