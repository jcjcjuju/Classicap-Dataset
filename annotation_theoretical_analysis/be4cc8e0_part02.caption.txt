This constitutes the development section of a sonata form. The passage functions as an episode that is largely independent of the thematic material presented in the exposition, with the sole exception of a fleeting allusion to the opening of the first subject. The developmental discourse is primarily generated from new motivic content introduced within this section itself. A short ascending sequence spans a significant portion of the episode, unified by the persistent recurrence of the pitch G in the accompaniment. This pedal-like G underpins the sequential activity and contributes to the harmonic ambiguity characteristic of the development. Motivic working is subtly employed, particularly in the manipulation of rhythmic and contour-based figures derived from the episode’s own material, including a notable correspondence between gestures in successive phrases. Harmonically, the section effects a return from the dominant key toward the tonic, though this return is mediated through modal inflection: the tonic is first asserted in the major mode and subsequently reinterpreted in the minor. A momentary digression suggests A minor, but the most striking harmonic event is the appearance of an Italian sixth chord in C minor, which introduces a dramatic chromatic color and serves as a pivotal sonority in the modulatory trajectory back to the tonic.
