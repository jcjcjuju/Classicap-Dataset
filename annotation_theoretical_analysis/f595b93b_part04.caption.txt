This constitutes the final agitato section of the movement, functioning as a dramatic synthesis and dissolution of prior thematic and harmonic material, ultimately culminating in a conclusive cadence in the minor mode. The passage begins in A minor with a persistent semiquaver pulse, establishing harmonic instability through rapid alternations among tonic, dominant seventh, and French augmented sixth chords (F–A–B–D♯), the latter resolving deceptively. Melodic lines are elaborated with upper and lower neighbour-note ornamentation, intensifying the sense of agitation. This gives way to a circle-of-fifths progression in the bass (A–D–G–C–F–B–E), driving toward a dominant seventh harmony, while upper voices introduce chromatic inflections that undermine diatonic clarity.

A subsequent sequential passage features a chromatically descending bass line, accompanied by heightened chromaticism in the upper voices, culminating in a resolution to the dominant via an inversion of the ii half-diminished seventh chord. This sequence is immediately transposed down an octave, preserving its harmonic trajectory and textural density. Following this, the bass ascends by semitones, generating harmonic dissonance through polychordal and whole-tone-derived sonorities—exemplified by chords such as F–A–B–D♯ and G–B–E♭—which evoke tonal ambiguity and expressive chaos.

The Presto con fuoco theme then reappears in a transformed variation, remaining firmly in A minor. Its phrases consistently cadence on dominant harmonies, reinforcing tonal tension. Within this variation, Bar 190 introduces a secondary dominant (V⁷/V) and diminished seventh chords, which propel the harmony through a cadential 6/4 progression to the dominant. A parallel progression in Bar 194 diverges unexpectedly, leading instead to a chain of diminished seventh chords and a French augmented sixth in Bar 196.

The tempo reverts to Tempo I as the opening theme returns, now transposed to A minor rather than its original F major. The characteristic repeated-note gesture is altered: the initial note is the tonic rather than the dominant. The harmony oscillates around the tonic chord in second inversion across several bars, with the final instance resolving the French augmented sixth from the preceding bar. After a moment of silence, the movement concludes with a stark and desolate V⁷–i cadence in A minor, affirming
