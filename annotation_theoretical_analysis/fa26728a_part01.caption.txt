This constitutes the exposition and recapitulatory complex of a sonata-form movement with developmental characteristics. The opening section establishes the tonic key of D major through a thematic statement that culminates in a perfect cadence in the tonic at an internal division, followed by a dominant pedal in A major leading to a perfect cadence in the dominant, thereby fulfilling the tonal trajectory typical of a sonata exposition. A coda follows, reinforcing the dominant key with material that will later be transposed to the tonic in the final section. The subsequent section functions as a development: it begins on the dominant of A major and modulates through a series of related keys—D major, G major, B minor, and E minor—before settling on B minor, the relative minor of the original tonic. This section concludes with a perfect cadence in B minor, preceded by a dominant pedal in that key. A transitional passage follows in the form of a descending sequential phrase that drives toward the dominant of the original key, culminating in a half cadence on A major. This is immediately succeeded by a brief descending scalar passage that resolves to the tonic D. The final section presents a recapitulation of the opening theme, now firmly in the tonic key, though it briefly touches upon G major (the subdominant) before reestablishing the tonic through a dominant pedal in D major. The movement concludes with a coda derived from the earlier dominant-key coda, now transposed to the tonic; this coda momentarily revisits B minor and G major before definitively closing in the original key of D major.
