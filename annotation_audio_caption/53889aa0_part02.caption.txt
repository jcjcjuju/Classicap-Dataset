The music begins with a familiar opening motive now heard in the bass, accompanied by rapid sixteenth-note figures reminiscent of earlier lyrical material. This motive is soon passed between voices through a series of inversions, creating a sense of restless dialogue. The harmony shifts quickly, departing from its initial key and moving through a succession of contrasting tonal centers—some dark and minor, others briefly luminous—before settling momentarily on a bright but unstable chord that immediately gives way to a new direction. A second section unfolds with the same core motive, now treated in imitative counterpoint, as the music continues its harmonic journey through fleeting glimpses of various keys, each arriving and dissolving in rapid succession. Tension builds steadily through repeated cadential gestures, culminating in a dominant seventh chord that hangs expectantly, poised to resolve into the return of familiar material.
