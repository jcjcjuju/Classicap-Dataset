A bold, lyrical theme unfolds in the alto, establishing a somber mood in B flat minor, soon joined by a restless stream of eighth-note figures that weave through the texture. The music builds with urgency, shifting to F minor as the main theme reappears in the treble, now more intense. A brief inversion of the theme’s opening notes flickers in the bass before the harmony brightens into D flat major, where the principal theme returns with warmth in the treble. This stability gives way to a darker turn as the theme emerges in the bass, then alto, in A flat major—the dominant of D flat—before migrating through G flat major with the theme passing between alto and treble. The tonal landscape grows more unsettled as the theme resurfaces in E flat minor, its character now shadowed and plaintive. Finally, the music circles back to B flat minor, where the theme is heard once more in the alto, leading to a firm, conclusive cadence. The movement closes with a sustained dominant pedal underpinning a final statement built from the quick eighth-note motif, now layered in both original and inverted motion, locking the music securely into its home key.
