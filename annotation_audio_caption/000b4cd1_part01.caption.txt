A bold, lyrical subject enters in the alto, establishing a stable home base in A flat major. It is soon answered in the treble with a slightly altered version that creates a gentle tension, supported by a graceful, chromatic counter-melody descending by semitones in the alto. A brief transitional passage shifts the harmony back to the home key, followed by the subject now in the tenor, paired with the same flowing counterpoint in the treble. The bass then presents the answer, again with the counter-subject in the tenor, momentarily pulling toward E flat major before a short episode weaves fragments of the subject through the voices while guiding the harmony back to A flat. The subject returns in the bass with the counter-subject above, then a fleeting codetta veers into F minor. An unaccompanied answer appears in the alto, followed by the subject once more in the tenor with its counterpoint restored in the alto. Another brief codetta explores distant harmonic colors—touching on D flat—before returning home, where the subject sings out clearly in the treble, joined only by the opening portion of the counter-subject in the bass. The music then moves into a darker realm: the subject reappears in the alto in F minor, entwined with the chromatic counterpoint in the treble. A more elaborate episode unfolds, filled with octave leaps, fragmented motifs, and running lines that carry the harmony through C minor to a somber E flat minor. There, the subject sounds alone in the tenor, unadorned. It is followed by an answer in the treble within the even more remote B flat minor, accompanied by the counter-subject in the alto. The subject then emerges in the bass in the warm but unexpected key of D flat major, with the counter-subject shimmering above in the treble. A final codetta gently steers the harmony back to the comforting stability of A flat major. The subject returns in the tenor, now with a more ornate, rhythmically active version of the counter-subject in the treble. Almost immediately, the bass interjects with the answer in close pursuit—a tight, overlapping imitation—without the usual counterpoint. After a brief pause, the music settles into a rich concluding passage: the full subject resounds in the tenor, now doubled in texture as a second tenor voice joins to complete the harmony, while the familiar chrom
