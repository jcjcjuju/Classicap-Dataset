The music begins with a lyrical theme in the home key, unfolding in two extended sections; the second section grows increasingly restless, dissolving mid-phrase into fragmented echoes of the movement’s opening idea, which flow seamlessly into a return of that bold, energetic principal theme. This return is transformed—its initial phrases stretched out with lingering pauses and expressive, speech-like freedom, as if improvising on earlier material. Within this reflective passage, the harmony briefly drifts into a darker, related minor key before introducing jarring chromatic chords that heighten the tension. A short, modified return of the earlier transitional episode follows, now firmly resolving into the home key, and leads directly into a final section that draws its character and contours from the lyrical second theme, momentarily colored by a striking, somber chord that adds a touch of dramatic weight before the movement’s close.
