The music begins with a clear, balanced phrase in D major that establishes a stable, bright tonal center, followed by a complementary phrase that moves to A major, creating a sense of gentle departure and harmonic warmth. This opening section concludes with a double bar and is typically repeated. A contrasting middle section follows, presenting a new phrase that builds mild tension by ending on an unresolved, expectant pause in D major—though in some variations, this pause remains within the home key rather than shifting elsewhere. The music then returns to material from the very beginning, restating the initial phrase to reaffirm the home tonality, and this final section also ends with a double bar and is usually repeated. In Variation VII, the entire structure is recast in a darker mood: the opening unfolds in D minor, followed by a shift to A minor, the middle phrase halts on a half-cadence in D minor, and the return draws again from the opening material, now shadowed by the minor mode’s somber quality.
