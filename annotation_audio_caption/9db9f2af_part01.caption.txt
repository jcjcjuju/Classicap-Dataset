A bold, stepwise theme in B flat major is introduced in the alto, followed by a higher, harmonically adjusted version in the treble that creates a sense of tension by shifting toward F major. A brief transitional passage smoothly returns the music to B flat before the theme reappears, now deep in the bass. A flowing interlude leads to a firm statement of the theme’s answer in the bass within F major, followed by another developmental passage that maintains momentum. The answer then emerges in the alto, still in F major, before a third interlude guides the harmony back toward B flat. The theme resurfaces clearly in the treble, reaffirming the home key. The music then ventures into new harmonic territory: a modulating passage shifts to G minor, where the theme is heard darkly in the bass. Another transition carries the ear to E flat major for a lyrical alto statement, which is soon followed by a further modulation to C minor, setting the stage for a stark treble presentation of the theme. An extended passage weaves through C minor and G minor before finally settling back into B flat major. There, a slightly varied form of the answer appears in the treble, leading into a conclusive section that draws on the opening motif and two recurring counter-themes, ultimately reinforcing the stability of B flat major with a decisive close.
