The section opens with a somber, three-chord gesture transposed into E minor, echoing the closing harmony of the earlier coda. What follows is an extended passage built from fragmented motifs drawn from the movement’s bold, energetic first theme, now reshaped and developed through varied harmonic and contrapuntal treatment. The lyrical second theme is absent entirely, leaving the texture focused on the rhythmic and melodic cells of the opening idea, explored with intensity and transformation throughout.
