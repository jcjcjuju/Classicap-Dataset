A bold, balanced theme in E-flat major opens with a four-bar phrase that creates a sense of anticipation by moving toward the dominant, then returns with subtle changes to settle firmly in the home key, completing an eight-bar statement. This is followed by a second eight-bar sentence that is then heard again immediately after, reinforcing its character. A brief interlude follows, weaving material from the opening theme into a transitional passage. The music then shifts to the brighter key of B-flat major for a lyrical second subject, presented in two complementary sections that each begin and end with a stable, resolved feeling in that key. Another transitional passage emerges, built over a sustained dominant note, gradually guiding the harmony back toward the home key of E-flat. The opening theme returns in its original form, sounding familiar and grounded. Finally, the mood darkens as the music moves into the minor mode of the home key, then unexpectedly shifts to G-flat major, creating a sense of departure and setting up what is to come.
