A bold, energetic theme unfolds in the home key, establishing a strong sense of stability that is immediately unsettled by a deceptive cadence halfway through—its resolution withheld by a dissonant embellishment that creates palpable tension, compelling the music to press forward. This suspense gives way to a brief, three-bar transition that leads not to closure but to an open, expectant pause in a new key. A contrasting lyrical idea then emerges in a brighter tonality, flowing in balanced two-bar phrases until a short three-bar passage disrupts the pattern with rhythmic variety. This is followed by two related four-bar phrases—the first ending inconclusively, the second rounding off with a satisfying cadence. A final, more ornate section begins with a six-bar melody and returns with delicate embellishments, after which a quiet, straightforward cadential wrap-up gently reaffirms the key before the music loops back to the beginning.
