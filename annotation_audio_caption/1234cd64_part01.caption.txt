Three distinct themes unfold simultaneously from the outset: a prominent melody in the upper voice, a supporting line in the bass, and a third, interwoven strand in the middle register, all moving together in intricate counterpoint. This layered texture continues with the themes shifting among the voices—sometimes the main melody appears in the middle with the others above and below—creating a rich, constantly shifting interplay. The music moves through a clear harmonic progression that settles with a strong sense of resolution in the key of F-sharp minor. It then enters a more restless phase, briefly touching brighter tonal areas before scale-like passages in the lower register help guide the harmony back, ultimately restoring the original key with all three themes sounding together once more in their initial configuration.
