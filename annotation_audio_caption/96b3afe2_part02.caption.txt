A new, rhythmically compressed version of the main theme emerges in the bass, immediately answered in a tightly woven imitative texture. This faster variant intertwines with a slower, stretched-out form of the same theme, creating a layered contrapuntal dialogue that unfolds with near-canonical precision. After this dense interplay, the music shifts to yet another transformation of the original theme, which is then developed through a series of variations. In the final moments, the theme appears upside-down, its contour inverted, as the harmony moves toward a point of tension marked by the dominant key.
