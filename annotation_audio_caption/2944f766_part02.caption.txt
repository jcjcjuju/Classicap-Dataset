The music begins with a passage built from quick, slurred eighth-note figures that weave through overlapping imitative entries, creating a dense, restless texture. A sense of forward motion unfolds as short phrases echo and shift upward in pitch, first settling into a somber E minor before brightening into D major through a clear sequential pattern. This searching quality continues with further modulations, briefly hinting at G major before arriving at a strong, conclusive cadence in B minor, heightened by the tense, yearning sound of an augmented sixth chord. The harmony then pivots decisively to G major, where a lyrical melody emerges—characterized by a repeating two-bar phrase that begins identically each time with the same three notes. This melody, familiar in shape but now in a new key, flows seamlessly into material recalling the earlier transition, its rhythmic drive in the bass echoing the codetta’s motive, until the passage settles back into the original transitional figures, now preparing for the return of the main themes.
