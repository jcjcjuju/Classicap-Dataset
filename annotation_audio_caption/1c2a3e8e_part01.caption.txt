A bold, stable theme in A major opens the movement, sounding grounded and resolved, with only a brief passage introducing tension before returning to the home key and closing firmly. This leads into a transitional passage that begins with a two-bar idea low in the bass, then immediately echoes it much higher in the treble, followed by another bass statement slightly higher than the first; the music then shifts through brighter harmonic territory before settling into a darker, more unsettled mood. A new lyrical theme emerges in a minor key, soon shifting to a brighter major key, then moving again through successive key changes that create a sense of wandering, until it finally arrives at a warm, conclusive phrase in a major key—this closing idea is then restated with its opening gesture flipped upside down. The section ends with a brief return of earlier material, tying together what has been heard.
