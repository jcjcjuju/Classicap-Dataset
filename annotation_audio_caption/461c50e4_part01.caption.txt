A bold theme in D minor opens the movement, unfolding over nine bars with a slightly extended opening phrase, establishing a stable yet somber home key. This gives way to a transitional passage that shifts from D minor toward a brighter C major, built from two balanced four-bar segments. The music then introduces a contrasting second theme in A minor—a darker, unexpected choice instead of the usual major-mode contrast—beginning with a four-bar idea that returns immediately, reshaped and stretched. The section closes with a brief coda drawn from earlier transitional material, echoing its character before the music comes to a decisive pause.
