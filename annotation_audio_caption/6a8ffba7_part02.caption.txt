A gentle, expressive episode unfolds, drawing its melodic material from earlier themes but recast with a poignant tenderness through the shift from major to minor mode. The music begins in G minor, its mood introspective and lyrical, then eases into the warmer, more hopeful sound of B flat major. This respite is brief, as the harmony soon turns darker again, slipping into C minor before finding its way back to the somber clarity of G minor, creating a subtle emotional arc of yearning and return.
