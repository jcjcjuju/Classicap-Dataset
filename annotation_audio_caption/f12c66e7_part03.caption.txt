A bold, lyrical theme in A flat major is heard, establishing a stable and grounded tonal center. This theme is then restated with heightened brightness, transposed up by an octave, preserving its character while adding a sense of elevation. The music then transitions into a concluding passage that brings the movement to a close, reinforcing the home key with a clear and satisfying resolution.
