A bold, energetic theme returns in its original stable home key, followed by a transitional passage that echoes earlier material but now unfolds in a warmer, more distant tonal color. A lyrical second theme emerges, first in a rich, mellow key, then shifts into a darker, minor inflection before turning toward a bright, expectant tonality. The music then settles into a lingering, resonant chord that creates a sense of suspended tension, eventually giving way to clear, recurring echoes of the opening theme, bringing the movement full circle with familiar, assertive gestures.
