A bold, stable theme returns in the home key, grounded by a steady tonal center. It leads into a transformed transitional passage that unfolds with inverted and varied material derived from the opening theme, unfolding more expansively than before and steering firmly back to the tonic. The lyrical second subject then enters, now cast in the somber hue of the tonic minor rather than the earlier major mode, its two-part structure shaped by expressive harmonic color—including striking Neapolitan sixth chords and a richly chromatic supertonic ninth—lending it a darker, more introspective character. The movement closes with a brief codetta that echoes the opening gesture, now securely anchored in the home key, bringing the music to a quiet, conclusive rest.
