A bold, angular subject begins in the upper voice, establishing a somber mood in E minor, and is immediately answered in the lower voice with a transposed version that shifts the tonal center to B minor, accompanied by a contrasting counter-melody above. This gives way to a flowing transitional passage that winds through changing harmonies from B minor toward the brighter key of G major. The subject then reappears in the upper voice in G major, now paired with its counter-melody below, followed by another transposed answer in the bass moving to D major, with the counterpoint returning above. A second transitional passage unfolds, steering the music from D major down to A minor. There, the subject emerges in the bass with its counterpoint above, only to be mirrored shortly after by an answer in the treble over a bass counter-subject, bringing the harmony back toward E minor. Another episode follows, weaving through E minor, G, and A before settling into D minor, where the subject sounds again in the bass with counterpoint above, then inverted in the treble with the counter-subject below, now in A minor. A final transitional passage begins in A minor, briefly touches G major, then abruptly snaps back to E minor. The music then fragments: snippets of the original subject and its counterpoint echo between treble and bass in E minor, culminating in a brief coda where the closing gesture of the subject is imitated in the upper voice, bringing the movement to a quiet, resolved close.
