A bold, energetic theme unfolds, built from distinct melodic fragments that create a sense of forward motion. The music first settles into a contrasting, warmer tonal area before shifting toward a darker, tense harmonic color that feels unresolved. It then moves through a plaintive, introspective passage in a related minor key, gradually brightening as it approaches a more stable, expectant harmony. From there, the music finds its way back to a clear and grounded tonal center, reaffirming a sense of home. This resolution is reinforced by a brief closing statement that draws on the opening melodic ideas, now sounding with quiet assurance and finality.
