A lyrical theme, originally introduced in the dominant key, now returns firmly grounded in the home key, unfolding in three distinct sections. The first section presents a melody derived from the movement’s opening idea, now in the bass and paired with a flowing counter-melody above, followed by a sequential modulation and a passage built over a sustained pedal tone where upper and inner voices move in contrary motion. This gives way to a second section that feels like an organic continuation, featuring a syncopated line intertwined with modulating sequences that echo earlier descending figures. The third section closes this thematic return with a descending scale passage, its second phrase varied to end with a strong, conclusive cadence. A brief connecting passage follows, recalling the earlier codetta with its pedal point and modulatory motion, now reoriented to reaffirm the tonic. The movement then draws to a close with a coda that brings back the bold, energetic character of the opening theme, weaving its motives into a final, decisive statement.
