A bold, fugal theme begins in the bass in the home key of F major, soon echoed an octave higher in the treble. This leads into a transitional passage built from the same theme, now unfolding in the brighter key of C major, creating a sense of forward motion. The section culminates in a new melody sustained over a steady, unchanging bass note, establishing a grounded yet luminous atmosphere before the music circles back to the beginning.
