A brief, overlapping theme opens the piece, presenting a compact idea twice in quick succession. This leads into a transitional passage that remains firmly grounded in the home key, creating a sense of stability before pausing with a feeling of incompleteness. A new theme then emerges in a contrasting, darker key, immediately echoed a step lower in a brighter, more expectant tonality where it continues to unfold. Within this section, a descending pattern repeats with slight variation, and the entire idea is extended through multiple restatements, eventually settling with a strong sense of closure. The music then lingers on this resolution, repeating and stretching the cadential gesture to reinforce the arrival.
