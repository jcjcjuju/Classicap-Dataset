The music begins with a stable, grounded feeling as a low D pedal tone anchors the opening, supporting a bold, energetic theme that soon returns with its voices flipped—upper and lower parts exchanging roles—while maintaining the same harmonic foundation. A shift in mood follows as the harmony briefly brightens into F major and then B-flat major, introducing a contrasting idea in the bass that is echoed back and forth between the voices. This gives way to a return to the home key’s region, leading to a strong, conclusive cadence in A minor—the dominant minor—bringing a sense of temporary arrival. The second half opens with a sustained A in the bass, creating tension and anticipation, over which a descending A minor scale unfolds. The harmony then drifts through G minor before gently turning toward D minor, ultimately resolving with finality in the home key of D major. The piece closes with a short coda, reaffirming the tonic with a steady D pedal beneath a calm, conclusive gesture.
