A bold fugue opens in a stable, resonant home key, its main theme introduced low in the bass and soon echoed higher up, accompanied by a lively counter-melody in quick notes. This theme returns in the upper register, followed by a brief, winding passage that builds tension and leads to a bright, expectant harmony. The theme and its echo continue to alternate, interspersed with episodes that develop fragments of the material, shifting through different harmonic colors—including a darker, more somber passage—before introducing a contrasting idea. The original theme then reappears in a new, distant key, followed by tightly overlapping entries that create a sense of urgency. The entire section culminates on a suspended, unresolved chord that hangs with anticipation. A sudden shift follows into a contrasting episode, now in a minor key, echoing material from another movement but reshaped and condensed, closing with a brief, brighter coda. The main theme then returns, flipped upside down and transposed, now unfolding in a new major key with its inverted shape answered and developed, creating a reflective yet purposeful character.
