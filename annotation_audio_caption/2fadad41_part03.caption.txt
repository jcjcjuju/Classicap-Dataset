A bold, somber theme in F minor opens with a four-bar phrase, immediately followed by a brighter, lyrical restatement in A-flat major. This is succeeded by a closing four-bar phrase, whose melodic contour is flipped upside down in the following bars, creating a sense of echoing inversion. The final portion of this section is heard twice, reinforcing its expressive shape before the music moves forward.
