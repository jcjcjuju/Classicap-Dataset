A bold, energetic theme in D major unfolds, first presenting an eight-bar phrase that creates a sense of anticipation by ending on a harmonically tense half-cadence, followed immediately by a second eight-bar phrase that resolves this tension with a clear and stable conclusion in the home key. This entire thematic statement is then heard again exactly as before. A brief, transitional passage follows, featuring a short melodic idea that is answered a fourth higher, creating a feeling of gentle harmonic motion. The opening theme then returns, now subtly varied and slightly extended, with the first few bars underpinned by a sustained dominant note in the bass that adds a layer of harmonic color. The section closes with a short coda that provides a final, conclusive wrap-up to the music.
