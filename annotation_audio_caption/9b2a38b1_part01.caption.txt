A bright and stable theme in A major unfolds in two balanced phrases, the first creating a sense of gentle tension by moving toward the dominant before the second phrase returns firmly to the home key. This is followed by a contrasting section that ventures into darker harmonic territory, briefly settling in G sharp minor before a series of tense, driving chords propel the music back to the reassuring stability of A major. The opening theme then returns in full, reaffirming its confident character, and the section closes with a brief coda that echoes fragments of the main theme, bringing the entire passage to a decisive and cohesive close.
