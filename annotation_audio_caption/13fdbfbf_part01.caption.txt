A slow, expressive passage unfolds with a fragmented, introductory character, opening with a harmonically tense sonority that creates a sense of unresolved anticipation. A distinctive melodic figure in the upper voice shapes much of the material, recurring and evolving throughout. The music maintains this searching, unsettled quality until it culminates in an ornamental flourish that lingers on the same tense harmony, heightening the expectation for resolution.
