A bold, four-note subject enters in the bass, establishing a clear home key, and is immediately answered in the treble with a tonally adjusted version that creates a bright, related-key contrast. The subject returns in the alto, flipped upside down, followed by a brief closing phrase that settles the harmony. The subject then appears in the treble, answered in the alto, both in the original key, before reappearing in the bass. It is soon heard again in the treble, now compressed in rhythm, and answered in the alto with the same rhythmic tightening, shifting into a darker minor key. The bass then presents a version that is both rhythmically compressed and inverted, leading into another brief closing passage that transitions through a minor key toward a brighter one. The subject re-enters in the bass of this new key, followed by answers in the alto and then the treble, which shifts the tonal center once more. Two tightly overlapping entries follow—first in the bass and alto, both inverted and in a minor key, with a treble answer above—then another pair in the bass and treble, again inverted but now in the original major key, with an alto answer. A final bass entry shifts to a new key, introducing a modulatory episode built on descending sequences and fragments of the inverted subject. This leads into a third stretto, with the subject in the bass and an inverted version in the treble, both in a minor key, answered in another minor key, then returning to a major key for another inverted statement. A short closing phrase guides the harmony back toward the home key, where the subject reappears in the bass. It is then transformed in the alto—both inverted and rhythmically compressed—and echoed in the bass with the same alterations, shifting briefly through minor keys before a rhythmically compressed version in the bass leads into a second episode, similar in construction to the first. After this, an answer appears in the bass in the home key, launching a final stretto: the subject, inverted, rings out in the treble, while the alto and bass respond with rhythmically stretched versions in contrasting keys. A brief closing passage follows, then a rhythmically expanded answer in the bass ushers in a passage centered on the dominant, where the inverted subject and its answers unfold in a minor inflection of the home key. This resolves into a varied, inverted subject in the alto, now restored to the bright home major
