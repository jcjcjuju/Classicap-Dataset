A bold, balanced theme unfolds in the home key, its initial four-bar idea answered by a six-bar extension that is then repeated in full, creating a sense of symmetry and closure with a strong, resolved cadence. This gives way to a rising transitional passage, built from a repeating pattern that grows in intensity, steering the music through bright, related keys before settling into a new, stable tonal center. There, a lyrical second theme emerges in two parts: the first begins with a graceful four-bar phrase that returns with subtle variation, followed by an unexpected reprise of most of its preceding material after a clear cadential pause; within this section, fleeting harmonic colors flash by as the music briefly touches on distant tonal areas through rich, inverted chords. The second part opens with a dialogue between high and low voices, echoing the transition’s opening gesture, then recalls the second theme’s initial melody before reshaping it anew; the entire section draws to a close with a firm, repeated cadence grounded over a sustained bass note, reinforcing the new tonal center with quiet insistence.
