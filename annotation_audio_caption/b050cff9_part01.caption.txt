The music opens with a balanced, eight-bar theme that establishes a stable home key, its first half ending with a sense of suspension and the second half—slightly reshaped—resolving firmly. This leads into a transitional passage that remains in the same key but builds anticipation by ending on a chord that feels like a poised launchpad, soon giving way to a contrasting theme in a brighter, related key. This new theme unfolds with lyrical grace, its phrases extended through gentle echoes and embellishments, including a shimmering trill above a lower-voice restatement of the melody. Brief shifts to a more somber mood color parts of this section, and the music revisits its closing ideas multiple times, each with subtle variation and one instance flipped upside down. The exposition closes with a brief, conclusive tag that signals a full repeat of everything just heard.
