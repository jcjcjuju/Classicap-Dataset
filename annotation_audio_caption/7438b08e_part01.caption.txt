A bold, energetic theme in D major unfolds in two balanced sections: the first creates a sense of anticipation by pausing on a harmonically tense dominant chord, and the second resolves that tension with a clear, stable conclusion in the home key. This is followed by a brief, shifting passage where a short melodic idea is echoed higher, creating a feeling of gentle harmonic motion. The opening theme then returns, now subtly reshaped and lengthened, with its initial bars underpinned by a sustained dominant tone that adds harmonic color. The part closes with a short coda that provides a final, conclusive gesture.
