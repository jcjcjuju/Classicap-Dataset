A bold, energetic theme emerges in A major, gradually building momentum toward a point of tension that resolves into a clear cadence in E major. This is followed by the same theme inverted in the bass, now centered in E, which briefly shifts into a darker, more introspective mood with a touch of B minor before settling into the warmer, melancholic hues of its relative minor; from there, the music finds its way back to a strong, conclusive return to the home key of A. The opening theme then reappears in its original form, now firmly in A major, weaving through fleeting glimpses of D major and B minor before reaffirming the tonic with a final, decisive cadence. The movement closes with a sustained emphasis on the home pitch, anchoring the entire piece with a sense of quiet finality.
