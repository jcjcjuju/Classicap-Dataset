A bold, rhythmic theme in F minor unfolds in clear two-bar phrases, creating a sense of urgency before pausing with unresolved tension. Fragments of this theme are then developed in a connecting passage that weaves its motives into a transitional fabric. The mood shifts as a contrasting theme emerges in the warmer, more luminous key of A flat major, offering lyrical relief. This section closes with a brief coda that wraps up the exposition, leading to a full repeat of the entire passage.
