A bold, structured theme opens in the home key, unfolding in two clear phrases—the second beginning lower and expanding the initial idea. This gives way to a transitional passage that shifts the music toward a brighter, more open sound, arriving at a point of poised anticipation. A new lyrical theme then emerges, built on a distinctive leap of a fourth, echoing the opening gesture but now in this new tonal area. It unfolds through a cascading series of imitations, each stepping downward, followed by a flowing continuation where rapid notes in the upper voice outline a melody by selectively highlighting certain pitches within each group, creating a shimmering, intricate texture.
