A bold, energetic theme in E major returns, presenting the movement’s opening material with its original character intact. This is followed by a transitional passage that echoes earlier motivic figures, now shifted to the key of A, creating a bright, expectant atmosphere. A lyrical, four-bar melody—previously heard in B major—now unfolds in A major, offering a warm but temporary tonal shift. From there, the music weaves a brief developmental passage drawn from this lyrical idea, gradually guiding the harmony back toward the home key. The opening theme then reappears in a varied form, enriched with embellishment and a conclusive tone, culminating in a final flourish that recalls the episode’s characteristic figure before the movement closes.
