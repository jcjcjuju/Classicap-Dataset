A bold, somber theme in F minor unfolds, establishing a stable yet melancholic home base before resolving to the warmer, brighter key of A flat major. This is followed by a flowing sequence that spins the musical idea through a series of repeating patterns, creating a sense of motion and development. The opening theme then returns, now reshaped to firmly reestablish F minor as its grounding tonality, lending a feeling of resolution and closure. The section concludes with a brief coda that reinforces this sense of finality.
