A new melodic idea unfolds first in the somber tone of F sharp minor, ending with a sense of suspension created by a striking augmented sixth chord resolving to the dominant. This phrase is followed by a second, longer one that begins similarly but soon shifts toward the brighter key of D major, concluding with a strong, emphatic cadence that is immediately echoed once more for reinforcement. A transitional passage then emerges, built from a sequence that winds through shifting harmonic colors—departing from D major, briefly touching on E minor, and finally settling into F sharp minor with another unresolved half-cadence. This leads into a return of the earlier melodic material, now reshaped to close firmly in the radiant key of F sharp major. The section draws to a close with a brief linking passage, its scale-like motion steering the harmony through the dusky hues of D minor before arriving decisively back in A major.
