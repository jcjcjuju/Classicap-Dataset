A bold, energetic theme in D major opens the movement, establishing a stable home base; this theme is immediately heard again, transposed slightly higher, and followed by a varied continuation that expands and refines its ideas before closing firmly in the home key. A substantial connecting passage follows, unfolding in three distinct segments that build momentum through contrasting musical ideas. This leads seamlessly into a lyrical second theme in A major, which unfolds in two balanced sections, each beginning and ending with a clear sense of arrival in the brighter, related key. The exposition concludes with a brief transitional passage that prepares for what is to come.
