A bold, energetic theme in G major returns, establishing a clear sense of home. This is followed by an extended passage that breaks the theme into shorter, fragmented gestures, maintaining its character while unfolding in a more disjointed and developmental manner. A new lyrical episode then emerges, rooted firmly in G major, drawing its material from a brief, recurring motif; this section flows smoothly and remains harmonically stable throughout. The movement concludes with a final, abbreviated statement of the main theme over a sustained G in the bass, reinforcing the tonal center with a grounded, resonant close.
