The music begins with a passage rooted in G minor, combining a bold, compact melodic idea from the opening of the first theme with a rapid, flowing sixteenth-note figure drawn from the second subject’s closing section. This material shifts through a series of tonal centers—moving from G minor to D minor, then briefly touching C major before settling into A minor, approached by a striking, resonant chord that creates a sudden, unexpected color before resolving. A short sequence follows, built from descending scale fragments that echo earlier gestures, winding through A minor and G minor toward F major, with the rapid sixteenth-note lines continually flipping their register or voice placement at each repetition. The texture then recalls the earlier transitional passage, leading into a focused, harmonically expectant passage centered on G—the dominant of the home key—where a varied version of the opening theme’s motive unfolds, culminating in a swift scale that propels the music directly into the return of the main theme.
