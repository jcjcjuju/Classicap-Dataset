A bold, self-contained theme in A-flat major establishes a stable, grounded feeling, concluding with a firm cadence that is immediately echoed once more for emphasis. This is followed by a brief transitional passage that shifts harmonically, moving through distant tonal areas before settling on a tense, unresolved chord that points toward F minor. Instead of introducing new material, the music returns to the opening theme and its transition, restating them in full. A contrasting lyrical idea then emerges, beginning unexpectedly in F major rather than the expected dominant key, but it gradually finds its way to a clear arrival in E-flat major. A short closing section follows, built from alternating harmonies that reinforce a sense of finality within the dominant key, though its character blurs the line between thematic material and codetta. The section ends with a brief, purposeful passage that smoothly circles back to the beginning for a repeat.
