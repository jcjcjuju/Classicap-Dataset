A bold, lyrical theme opens in E major, grounded by a sustained bass note that anchors the harmony while the melody unfolds in balanced phrases; this material is immediately echoed lower and higher in pitch, creating a sense of playful variation. The music then flows seamlessly into a transitional passage that reuses the opening gesture before shifting harmonically toward a brighter, more luminous key. There, a graceful second theme emerges—first stated plainly, then imitated slightly lower, and soon repeated with subtle changes in the bass line. A new four-bar idea follows, closing with a strong sense of anticipation, and this too is immediately restated. Afterward, a fresh rhythmic figure appears, introducing a more decisive character, and the section builds toward a close marked by a striking, resonant clash of parallel fifths. The movement’s closing bars draw on the opening theme in the bass, guiding the harmony back from tension to the reassuring stability of the home key.
