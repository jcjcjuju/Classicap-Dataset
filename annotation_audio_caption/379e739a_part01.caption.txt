A bold, distinctive theme opens in the upper voice, establishing a stable home base in B flat major. Soon, a closely related version of this theme enters in the middle voice, now in F major, while the upper voice weaves a new, complementary line against it. The original theme then resurfaces in the lowest voice, back in B flat major, as the middle voice takes up the first accompanying line and the top voice introduces a second, independent counter-melody. This intricate interplay continues as the theme’s variant appears in the upper voice again, with the lower voices exchanging their counter-melodies. The music then shifts into a transitional passage that moves from F major toward G minor, built from descending patterns derived from the theme. The main theme reappears in the middle voice in G minor, now layered with both counter-melodies in the other voices, followed by its variant in the bass in C minor, again with the two counter-lines above. Another transitional passage unfolds, this time moving through C minor and G before returning to C minor, and then the theme’s variant is heard in the middle voice in E flat major, with both counter-melodies present. The original theme returns in the upper voice in E flat major, supported by the same two accompanying lines below. Finally, the theme’s variant sounds once more in the middle voice, now back in the home key of B flat major, with both counter-melodies intact, leading into a brief closing section in E flat major that brings the movement to a calm conclusion.
