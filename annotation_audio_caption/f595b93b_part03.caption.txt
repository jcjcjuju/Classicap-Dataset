A gentle, nostalgic theme returns, now unsettled and fragmented—its two opening phrases fused into one incomplete gesture, trailing off into silence. This is followed by a somber passage in A minor, echoing earlier harmonic turns. The closing material reappears with its characteristic dotted rhythms, but the expected resolution is shattered by a dissonant diminished seventh chord. A new contrapuntal episode unfolds in D flat major, with the melody imitated between upper and lower voices over a sustained dominant bass, soon dissolving through diminished harmonies into G flat major. Tension surges as the closing idea transforms into a dense, driving passage, louder and faster, with the dotted rhythmic motif pulsing insistently. A bold, defiant statement of the opening theme erupts in B flat major, only to collapse abruptly onto a dissonant chord. The original melody then resurfaces deep in the tenor register in E major, later migrating to the bass in C major. A transposed version of the contrapuntal episode follows, shifting through C major toward F major, yet avoiding a clear cadence. The closing material recurs again, darker and more urgent, before a forceful variation of the main theme in G minor gives way to D minor, its bass sinking by half steps. Suddenly, the mood erupts into a furious Presto con fuoco: a stormy theme in D minor, then A minor, charges forward with relentless sixteenth notes and brusque gestures, building through repeated dominant tensions without resolution.
