A melody in B flat major begins with a sustained foundational tone beneath it, creating a stable yet expectant atmosphere; this theme gradually shifts toward F major, passing through G minor and F major in a sequence of echoing phrases. A contrasting passage follows, starting in a darker C minor and winding through B flat minor before settling again into F major, using a condensed version of the earlier melodic idea in a tightly wound sequence. The initial melody then returns, now adjusted to conclude firmly in the home key of B flat major. A brief connecting passage emerges, built from a small, recognizable fragment of the main theme. The music then shifts to E flat major, introducing a new lyrical melody that soon moves toward B flat major; this idea is developed in a passage where the opening repeated-note figure appears in the bass with inverted motion, and the melody itself is turned upside down in a mirror-like transformation. The E flat major melody returns once more, now closing securely in its own key. A final link unfolds with a slithering chromatic line first in the bass, then imitated higher in the treble with the voices flipped, before ending with a familiar phrase drawn from the movement’s principal theme.
