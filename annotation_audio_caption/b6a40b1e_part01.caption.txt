The music begins with a theme in A minor, unfolding through a series of melodic figures that create a sense of gentle forward motion. It soon shifts toward a darker, more tense area before settling into a brighter, stable tonality—the relative major—through a stepwise descent, concluding with a clear and resolved cadence. A new passage follows, wandering through several tonal centers: a warm major sound, then a somber minor, and another shift to a different minor key, before gracefully turning back toward the original home key. The opening theme returns, now subtly altered, firmly rooted in the tonic. A sustained bass note anchors the harmony as the music draws to a close, reinforcing the home key with quiet certainty.
