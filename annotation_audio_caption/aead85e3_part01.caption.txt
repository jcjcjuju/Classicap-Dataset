A bold, four-note motif in D minor opens the movement, establishing a tense and grounded home key; this idea permeates the entire section. The music then transitions through a connecting passage where the same motif appears in the bass, shifting from D minor to a brighter C major before pivoting—via a striking augmented sixth chord—to a bright E major chord that creates strong forward momentum. A new theme follows in A minor, introduced by a concise two-note figure, offering a contrasting mood while still echoing the rhythmic essence of the opening. This second theme is then developed and extended in a closing section that elaborates on its latter phrases, before a brief transitional passage leads smoothly back to the beginning, preparing for a full repeat of the exposition.
