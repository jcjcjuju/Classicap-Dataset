A bold subject begins in the bass, establishing a stable D major foundation, soon answered in the tenor with a brighter, harmonically tense version in A major. A brief codetta follows, leading to the subject’s reappearance in the alto, again grounded in D major, and another answering statement in the treble. A second codetta echoes fragments of the subject’s opening gesture before the bass reasserts the full subject once more. The music then shifts direction: the answer appears in the treble but now colored by the darker hue of B minor, ushering in a transitional passage that fluidly moves toward G major while introducing new melodic ideas alongside fragments of the subject. The subject returns clearly in the treble in G major, then immediately in the alto back in D major, followed by an incomplete answer in the bass. The tenor takes up the subject again in G major, leading to a decisive answer in the bass that settles into the somber key of E minor. Another transitional passage unfolds, mirroring the earlier one but reversing the roles of treble and bass, as the harmony winds back toward G major. Fragmented imitations of the subject’s opening flourish emerge freely across the voices, culminating in a final return to D major where familiar figures from the subject are woven into a conclusive, affirming close.
