The music begins with a bright, assertive fragment of the opening theme now sounding in C major, lending it a more open and stable quality compared to its original minor mode. This gives way to a lyrical, flowing idea—originally introduced as the second subject—now heard first in the somber tones of F minor and then again in the darker, more intense key of B flat minor; in both appearances, the harmony alternates simply between each key’s home chord and its dominant, creating a grounded yet restless effect. The texture then shifts as a sequence of graceful, recurring melodic phrases emerges, drawn from earlier transitional material, unfolding over shifting harmonies and building momentum through a sustained bass note that gradually leads back toward the return of the main theme.
