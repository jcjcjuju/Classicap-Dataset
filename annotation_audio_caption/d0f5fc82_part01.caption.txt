The music opens with a lyrical theme in the home key, unfolding in three balanced phrases that flow smoothly and singably. This is followed by a more rhythmically driven idea, extended slightly by repeated cadential gestures that reinforce a sense of closure. Shortly after, the melody briefly echoes in the lower register while the upper parts continue, creating a layered effect. A transitional passage then emerges with a shift to a darker, more introspective mood in a related minor key; this idea is restated and soon moves into another minor key, accompanied by flowing broken-chord patterns that shift harmonically—first over a minor chord in inversion, then over a flattened submediant, and finally over a striking, tense chord that resolves into a moment of suspense in the same minor key. The music then arrives at a contrasting theme in a brighter, stable major key, presented in clear four-bar segments; its second half mirrors the first but concludes more decisively. This gives way to a section that alternates between major and minor shades of the same key: it begins with the melody in the bass, dips into the minor mode an octave lower, briefly touches a distant major key through stepwise motion, and then settles into repeated halting cadences in the minor. Finally, the mood lifts back to the major mode with a gentle, two-bar idea that soon returns an octave higher, enriched with extended closing gestures before a brief codetta wraps up the section.
