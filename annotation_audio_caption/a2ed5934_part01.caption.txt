The music opens with a distinctive, richly colored chord that creates a sense of poised instability, soon settling into a clear, stable tonal center. A lyrical and balanced theme unfolds, then reappears higher in pitch, preserving its character while shifting its sonic space. A brief, more animated idea follows and is immediately restated with subtle variation, leading to a short, conclusive closing phrase that wraps up this opening section smoothly. Without pause, the music flows into a transitional passage that briefly recalls the opening theme’s unusual chord—now tinged with a darker, more tense quality—before building momentum toward a new tonal goal. A contrasting second theme emerges in a brighter, related key, graceful and songlike; after a brief linking passage, this melody returns with gentle alterations. The section closes with fresh material centered around the dominant key: clear, ringing arpeggios outline a bright major chord, then shift to a more intense dominant harmony with a shimmering trill, and fragments of earlier melodies briefly resurface before a final connecting gesture, drawn from the closing material, leads seamlessly back to the beginning.
