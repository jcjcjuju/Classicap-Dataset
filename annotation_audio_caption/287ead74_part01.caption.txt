The music opens with a bold, eight-bar theme in F minor, split into two balanced phrases: the first creates a sense of suspense by halting unexpectedly, while the second resolves firmly, grounding the listener in the home key. Without transition, a contrasting theme emerges in the warmer, brighter key of A-flat major, unfolding over twelve bars with interweaving melodic lines that echo one another. Within this section, striking harmonies color the texture—a tense, rich chord that pulls strongly toward resolution appears midway, followed shortly by a delicate, unstable sonority that adds expressive depth. The passage closes with a brief codetta that recalls the movement’s opening gesture, now distilled into a concise closing idea.
