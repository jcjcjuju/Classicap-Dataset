A bold, stable theme in G major unfolds with a clear eight-bar structure, followed by a shorter four-bar idea; this latter portion then returns, reinforcing the opening mood before closing firmly in the home key. A shift to G minor introduces a contrasting episode, beginning with a brief transition before presenting a plaintive four-bar phrase that settles into D minor; this same phrase returns, now reshaped and lengthened, leading the music into the warmer, more distant key of B flat major. A brief linking passage follows, setting up a new lyrical theme in B flat major—unexpectedly distant from the expected dominant—whose final section is immediately heard again, deepening its expressive character. The earlier episode then reappears in full, but its closing bars now turn toward G minor instead of B flat, creating a darker resolution before another short connector ushers back the original bright G major theme in its complete form.
