A fugue unfolds with a clear subject introduced in the alto, followed by a real answer in the treble that shifts the tonal center, creating a sense of departure. Additional entries quickly follow—another answer in the tenor, then the subject returns in the bass, grounding the music back in the original key. The texture intensifies as subject and answer overlap in close succession, producing a layered, imitative dialogue. This overlapping continues with increasing density: a subject in the treble is immediately shadowed by an answer in the tenor; later, the bass and alto entries intertwine in stretto. The harmony moves through related keys—G major, A minor, C major, D minor, and D major—each shift marked by new entries of the subject or answer, sometimes complete, sometimes cut short. Three full stretti emerge, each involving all voices in tightly woven counterpoint, building momentum through rhythmic and harmonic tension. The music eventually settles back into the home key with a strong cadence, followed by a final statement of the subject over a sustained bass note. The closing passage spins out rapid, decorative figures drawn from the subject’s ending and its opening ascent, bringing the fugue to a bright, conclusive close.
