A bold, distinctive theme emerges in the upper voice, establishing a bright and stable tonal center. It is soon answered in the middle voice with a subtly adjusted version that creates a sense of harmonic movement, while a complementary counter-melody unfolds above it in a darker, more plaintive mood. The theme then resurfaces in the lowest voice, now accompanied by a related but altered counterpoint in the middle register. A new, lively rhythmic figure appears, passed between voices and driving a shift toward a brighter key. The original theme returns in the upper voice, now paired with its counterpoint in a more harmonically settled context. This gives way to a second episode where the new figure briefly echoes the theme’s shape, supported by a sprightly bass line, leading into another statement of the adjusted theme in the middle voice with counterpoint below. A third episode follows, again featuring the active bass figure, steering the music into a more somber tonality, where the main theme reappears in the bass with fragmented counterpoint above. An extended passage then unfolds with long, suspended harmonies in the upper voices over the continuing bass motif, which later shifts to the top voice while the lower parts provide steady rhythmic support. Near the end, the theme is imitated between upper voices while a fresh bass idea emerges. Finally, the theme returns once more in the upper voice with its counterpoint now in the bass, resolving into a closing passage that weaves together the recurring episodic figure in a bright, conclusive mood.
