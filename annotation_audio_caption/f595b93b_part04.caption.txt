A restless, agitated passage unfolds in A minor, driven by a constant stream of sixteenth notes. The harmony swirls with tension, alternating between the home chord, a dissonant French augmented sixth, and dominant seventh chords, all embellished with quick neighbor notes that flicker around the main pitches. A sweeping circle-of-fifths progression propels the music forward, its bass line descending stepwise through a chain of keys while the upper voices weave chromatic lines. This gives way to another sequence, now with a bass that slides downward by half-steps, pulling the harmony through shadowy, unstable colors before landing on a dominant chord—then the entire gesture drops an octave, deepening its unease. The bass then begins to climb by semitones, clashing with increasingly chaotic upper voices that form eerie, whole-tone harmonies. A variation of the earlier fiery theme emerges, still in A minor, repeatedly circling back to the dominant chord as if searching for resolution; a surge of secondary dominants and diminished chords intensifies the drive, only for the path to twist unexpectedly into more dissonant harmonies and another French sixth. Suddenly, the tempo relaxes, and the gentle opening melody returns—but now haunted, in A minor instead of F major, its repeated notes grounded on the tonic rather than the dominant. The harmony lingers on unstable second-inversion tonic chords before finally resolving the earlier tension. After a brief silence, the piece ends with a stark, hollow cadence: a dominant seventh collapses into a final, desolate A minor chord.
