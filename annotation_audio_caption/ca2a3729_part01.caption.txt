The music opens with a clear, grounding pedal tone that immediately establishes a stable home key, soon giving way to a somber shift toward a neighboring minor area, creating a subtle sense of departure. This leads into a more pronounced move to a darker, tense harmonic region that feels like a temporary resting point but carries a strong pull forward. From there, the harmony begins a winding journey back, passing through several fleeting minor tonalities—each briefly coloring the sound with its own shade of melancholy—before finally settling into the original key with a firm, conclusive resolution. A short closing passage lingers on the home pedal tone, reinforcing the sense of return and finality.
