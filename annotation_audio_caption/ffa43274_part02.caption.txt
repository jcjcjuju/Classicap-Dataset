A lyrical theme, first heard softly in the tonic key, now returns transformed in a darker, more restless mood, set in F sharp minor and underpinned by a sustained dominant pedal. This theme is soon distilled to its opening seven notes, which are developed through a series of shifting harmonic landscapes—moving from the somber hues of F sharp minor to the brighter clarity of A major, then into the plaintive tones of C sharp minor and B minor, before a sequential passage guides the music back to the reassuring stability of A major.
