A new theme begins with a somber, introspective quality in B minor, soon shifting to the darker, more intense sound of F sharp minor, where its opening gesture returns in a transformed version. This material then reappears once more, now cast in the brighter, more open sound of G major, before resolving into the stable, reassuring tonality of D major, seamlessly leading into the return of the opening theme.
