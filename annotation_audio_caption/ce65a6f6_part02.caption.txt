A brief passage in C major evokes the character of the opening theme, followed by a shortened return of the second subject, now centered in the home key of E major; this reprise begins with a hint of the subject’s earlier form before settling into its second portion. The music then presents a varied version of the bold, lyrical first subject in E major, leading into a closing section that recalls motifs from this same opening theme, bringing the movement to a cohesive end.
