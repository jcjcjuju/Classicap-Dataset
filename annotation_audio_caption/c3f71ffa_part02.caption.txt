The music begins with a clear, familiar theme now heard in a brighter key, soon shifting toward uncertainty as the harmony drifts between two tonal centers, creating a sense of instability. A series of subtle but striking harmonic shifts—achieved through enharmonic reinterpretations—guides the ear through unexpected turns, eventually settling into a new, darker key. From there, a tightly woven sequence unfolds over sustained dominant tones, its four-bar pattern repeating with suspended tensions and gradually moving through a chain of minor keys, each step deepening the sense of searching unrest. This gives way to a descending passage where melodic fragments from an earlier lyrical section emerge in the upper voice, supported by a rhythmic undercurrent borrowed from the closing gestures of the exposition. The motion continues downward, now placing those same fragments in the bass, building momentum until a swift chromatic run propels the music forward, bridging to what comes next.
