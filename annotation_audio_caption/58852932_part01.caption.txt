A bold, distinctive theme emerges in the bass, establishing a stable home base in B major, followed by a brief connecting passage. The theme then appears in the tenor, transposed to F sharp major, accompanied by a contrasting counter-melody in the bass. Another short link leads back to B major, where the theme is heard in the alto with the same counter-melody now in the tenor. This pattern continues as the theme returns in the treble in F sharp major, again paired with the counter-melody, and another brief passage guides the music back to B major for a final statement of the theme in the bass with the counter-melody in the treble. A flowing, harmonically restless interlude follows, shifting from B to F sharp major, after which the theme reappears in the tenor in F sharp major but now paired with a new, more intricate counter-melody in the treble. Another transitional passage modulates back to B major, where the theme sounds in the alto, accompanied by fragments and then a full statement of this new counter-melody in the lower voices. A third interlude, marked by suspensions and echoes of the new counter-melody, moves the harmony toward F sharp major, setting up another appearance of the theme in the treble with the new counter-melody in the alto. The music then shifts through darker, minor-key territories—D sharp minor, G sharp minor, and C sharp minor—with the theme and its new counter-melody appearing in different voices, each time framed by brief modulating links. A substantial episode unfolds, built on the new counter-melody, steering the harmony toward a bright E major before the theme returns in G sharp minor with the counter-melody above. An extended, harmonically searching passage then gradually makes its way back to B major. The theme reappears in the bass in this home key, now briefly touched by fragments of the earlier counter-melody in an unusual alignment. Two more transitional episodes follow, the first veering toward D sharp minor and the second returning to B major via F sharp, each colored by echoes of the newer counter-melody. The theme is then heard clearly in the treble in B major, supported by the newer counter-melody in the tenor, before a final, conclusive section firmly reaffirms the home key.
