A bold, balanced theme unfolds in the home key, presenting a clear musical idea that is soon varied and reaffirmed with a strong sense of closure. This leads into a lyrical, flowing passage that echoes its opening gesture at a higher pitch, gently steering the music toward a new tonal center. There, a contrasting theme emerges with an irregular, asymmetrical phrasing—its short melodic fragment answered by a longer reply, only to be cut off unexpectedly before full resolution. The music then shifts to a new texture built on arpeggiated chords, sharply contrasting the earlier stepwise motion; this new idea is stated, repeated, and extended, briefly touching on a distant key before settling into a firm cadence in the new tonal area. The section closes with a sustained pedal point under quiet, cadential gestures that reaffirm the stability of this new key.
