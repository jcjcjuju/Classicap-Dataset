A bold subject emerges in the upper voice, firmly rooted in E flat but soon shifting toward B flat, followed immediately by a brief, lively codetta built from quick sixteenth notes that will recur throughout the piece. The answer enters in the middle voice, adjusted to preserve tonal stability, while a contrasting counter-melody unfolds above it. This codetta figure returns, now expanded, leading to the subject’s appearance in the lowest voice, accompanied by the same counter-melody in the middle register. A flowing episode follows, weaving the codetta’s rhythmic idea through a modulation back to the home key, then gives way to the answer in the upper voice with a new counterpoint below. The music then moves through a series of modulating episodes—first descending by sequence into a somber C minor, where the answer and counter-subject appear again—followed by another codetta and a deep statement of the subject in the bass over a shifting harmonic landscape. Further episodes spiral through distant keys, including G minor and A flat, using the original codetta material with increasing complexity, until the subject returns brightly in the treble. The final episode navigates a path through rich harmonic territory before settling back into E flat, where the answer sounds once more in the alto without its usual companion, leading into a closing passage that echoes the opening’s descending gesture in the bass.
