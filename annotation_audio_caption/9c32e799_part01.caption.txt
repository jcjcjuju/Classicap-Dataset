A bold, structured theme unfolds in clear four-bar phrases, establishing a stable tonal center. Its second phrase briefly suggests a shift toward a brighter, related key, but the expected resolution remains subtly incomplete. The theme returns with the same melody, now enriched by rapid sixteenth-note motion in the bass, which later migrates to the upper voice. Melodic patterns repeat and shift upward in pitch, creating a sense of forward motion. A brief transitional passage follows, grounded by a sustained bass note and ending with an unresolved pause. A new lyrical idea emerges in a brighter key, built from the opening theme’s core motif now heard in the lower register, paired with a fresh, flowing counter-melody above. This material is soon restated a step lower, slipping into a more somber mood before regaining brightness and culminating in a strong half-cadence. Over a steady bass note, the main motif reappears in the treble, mirrored in contrary motion by a middle voice, creating intricate interplay. After the pedal tone fades, arpeggiated chords and broken harmonies lead to a graceful cadence. The music then flows into a syncopated, descending line that feels like a natural outgrowth of what came before, its shifting harmonies lending a sense of gentle unpredictability. This gives way to another descending scale-based idea, presented twice—first ending inconclusively, then with a firm, satisfying close. A final brief passage, sustained over a pedal tone, smoothly guides the harmony back to the original key.
