A lyrical subject unfolds in A flat major, conveying a warm, stable character, and gradually shifts toward E flat major, creating a gentle sense of arrival. This material is then heard again, beginning almost immediately from its second measure. Following this, an episode emerges with a persistent rhythmic pattern matching the preceding subject, but now built entirely over a dominant ninth chord, producing a sustained, tense harmonic color that pulses with unresolved energy.
