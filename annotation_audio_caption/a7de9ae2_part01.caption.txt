An impassioned, singing melody unfolds over a steady pulse of chords repeated three times per bar. The music moves through a series of harmonic destinations, first settling briefly in a stable home tonality, then shifting to a darker, more distant key before arriving at a firm cadence in a somber, minor-mode tonality a fifth above the original. This sense of arrival is soon unsettled as the harmony begins to wander, avoiding resolution and creating a feeling of continuous motion. The movement ultimately winds down in a reflective coda, where expected closures are evaded twice in succession, leaving the music suspended in poignant uncertainty.
