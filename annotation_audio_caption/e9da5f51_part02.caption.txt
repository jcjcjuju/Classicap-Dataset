A passage unfolds with a strong emphasis on the dominant pitch B flat, creating a sense of anticipation. It quickly shifts to E flat major, establishing a new tonal center, and then alternates steadily between chords that sound stable and those that create tension, reinforcing the harmonic pull between home and resolution. Throughout, fragments reminiscent of the lyrical second subject—characterized by imitative lines and sequential patterns—form the core of the musical material, weaving a sense of continuity while building momentum toward the return of the opening theme.
