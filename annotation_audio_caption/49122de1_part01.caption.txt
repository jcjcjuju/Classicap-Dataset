A bold, angular subject in G minor emerges in the tenor voice, soon answered in the alto with a version that shifts toward D minor, accompanied by a contrasting counter-melody in the tenor. The subject returns in the treble, now back in G minor, with the counter-subject in the alto, followed by a bass entry of the answer in D minor paired with the counter-subject in the treble. A brief transitional passage weaves through harmonic shifts from D minor back to G minor, leading to another statement of the subject in the tenor, now supported by the counter-subject in the bass. The music then moves through a series of modulations: a second episode carries the harmony to D minor, where the subject appears in the alto with the counter-subject above; next, in B-flat major, the subject is heard in the treble with the counter-subject in the alto; then in F major, the bass presents the answer while the treble carries the counter-subject. Another episode guides the music toward B-flat major, where the subject is sung in close harmony—thirds—by alto and tenor, with the counter-subject in the bass. A short episode pivots the tonality toward C minor, setting up a new statement of the subject in treble and alto in sixths, accompanied by the counter-subject in the tenor. Yet another episode leads to E-flat major, where both subject and counter-subject are simultaneously rendered in rich, interwoven thirds across all four voices. A final episode returns the harmony to G minor, ushering in a restatement of the subject in the tenor with the counter-subject in the alto, followed immediately by a fuller texture: subject in treble and tenor, counter-subject in alto and bass, all in G minor. This culminates in a closing phrase that firmly resolves to G minor, then gives way to a reflective coda—built from fragments of the counter-subject in the upper voices—before a final, slightly varied statement of the subject in the bass, shadowed by echoes of the counter-subject in the middle voices.
