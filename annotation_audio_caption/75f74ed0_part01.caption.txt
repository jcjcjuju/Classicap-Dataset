A bold subject enters in the tenor, establishing a bright, stable tonality, soon answered by a slightly altered version in the alto that shifts the harmonic center, creating a sense of gentle tension. As this answer unfolds, a contrasting counter-melody appears in the tenor, weaving around the new voice. The subject then rises to the treble, now back in the original key, while the alto takes up the counter-melody. Next, the bass presents the answer, with the treble continuing the counterpoint in the shifted key. A brief closing phrase follows, echoing the opening gesture of the counter-melody. The subject returns once more in the tenor, reaffirming the home tonality. A transitional passage then guides the music toward a brighter, more expectant key, where the subject reappears in the alto and concludes firmly in this new tonal area. The subject is then heard upside-down in the treble, followed immediately by its inverted answer in the alto, both in the same bright key. The original form of the subject resurfaces in the bass, returning to the home tonality, only to be followed by an answer in the tenor that settles into a darker, more somber key. Another transitional passage emerges, gradually guiding the harmony back toward the original tonality. The subject reenters in the alto, firmly reestablishing the home key, and is answered in the treble while the alto reintroduces the full counter-melody. The movement closes with a brief coda in the home key, where fragments of the counter-melody’s opening notes linger in the tenor, offering a final, reflective echo.
