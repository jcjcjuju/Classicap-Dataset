A soft and lyrical theme unfolds in A major, grounded by a sustained bass note that creates a calm, stable foundation. This gentle mood is abruptly shattered by a sudden burst of loud, accented chords, introducing a turbulent passage that briefly hints at darker tonalities before settling into a brighter, more assertive key. A new melody then emerges, characterized by rhythmic dotted figures and ornamental turns, passed between the hands—delicate in the right, forceful in the left—while fleeting shadows of minor keys color the harmony. The music gradually winds toward a conclusive close, maintaining this interplay of grace and intensity.
