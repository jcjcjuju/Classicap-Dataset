A bold, fugal theme unfolds in B flat major, introduced clearly and then immediately echoed with subtle variation, accompanied by a distinct counter-melody. This theme returns in the bass, slightly condensed, while the counter-melody reappears above it. The music then moves through an extended passage that weaves together fragments of the main theme, its counter-melody, and a brief closing idea, eventually arriving at a new statement of the theme in the higher register, now in A flat major. A further episode develops the closing gestures of the theme and part of the counter-melody, employing intricate contrapuntal interplay, and settles into G flat major. From there, a chain of imitative entries, based on a short motive, drives the harmony downward through related keys until it reaches E flat minor, setting the stage for the theme’s return—now transformed into a darker, augmented version in that key. This altered statement is partially echoed in the upper voice and then inverted in the bass, before the section closes with a sense of arrival in D flat major.
