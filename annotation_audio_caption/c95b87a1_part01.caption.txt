A bold, energetic theme in B flat major begins the movement, establishing a stable home base; this theme unfolds over eight bars and arrives at a point of tension before returning in a varied form that resolves firmly back to the home key, concluding with a strong cadence. A brief transitional passage follows, introducing a new melodic idea that starts in the home key but shifts toward a brighter, more expectant tonal center. This leads into a contrasting lyrical subject in F major, which gradually builds momentum through shimmering arpeggiated figures—rapid thirty-second-note patterns in the right hand layered over steady eighth-note arpeggios in the left, all anchored by a sustained bass note for the first part of the section. The music then shifts again, as fragments of the opening theme are passed between voices in imitative counterpoint, guiding the harmony back toward the original key. Finally, the bold opening theme returns in its original key, reaffirming the movement’s central tonal identity.
