A bold, imitative opening unfolds as the upper voice is closely echoed by the tenor a bar later, establishing a tightly woven dialogue. A new melodic idea soon emerges in the treble and is immediately repeated in a descending sequence over the next two bars, creating a sense of gentle momentum. Midway through, this first theme reappears in the tenor within a brighter, relative major color before the music settles into a conclusive cadence in a darker, minor key built on the dominant. The following section returns to the original tonal center, developing both themes with intricate imitation between voices; however, the second theme gradually fades away, leaving the first theme to be explored more freely, with the bass now echoing and reshaping its contours in the upper voice, all while maintaining a consistent tonal focus that relies on inventive treatment rather than harmonic contrast for its expressive depth.
