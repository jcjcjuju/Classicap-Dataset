A bold, self-contained theme unfolds in the home key, structured in two balanced sentences that each conclude with a strong sense of finality. Within this opening idea, a responsive phrase appears in a compressed three-bar form before returning in an expanded five-bar version, subtly stretched at both beginning and end. This gives way to a lyrical transition: after two brief bars in a somber minor mode, a flowing melody emerges in a warm, contrasting key, then returns with added length and harmonic motion, weaving through several keys before settling into a brighter, stable tonality. The second theme enters in this new key, blending transformed versions of the opening motives—now heard simultaneously rather than one after the other—creating a rich, interwoven texture; this idea is soon restated with heightened tension over a dissonant diminished chord. The section closes with a short, graceful phrase that echoes itself with slight variation and a gentle extension, reinforcing the new tonal center before the music prepares to begin again.
