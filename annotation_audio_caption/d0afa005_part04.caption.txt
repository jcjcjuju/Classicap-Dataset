A bold, rhythmically driven theme in C minor returns, firmly reestablishing the home key. This is followed by a transitional passage that opens with the same assertive opening gesture of the main theme, then unfolds with material derived from its middle portion, creating a sense of continuity while steering the music in a new direction. The lyrical second theme now appears first in the darker hue of F minor before shifting into the warm stability of C minor, where its full expressive arc unfolds. The movement draws to a close with a final echo of the main theme, a solemn four-bar interlude recalling the opening introduction’s character, and a last, decisive statement of the primary motif.
