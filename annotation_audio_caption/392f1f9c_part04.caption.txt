A somber, yearning melody unfolds in A minor, anchored by a persistent dominant pedal in the bass; the tune repeatedly climbs toward its tonic note with rising urgency, only to be deflected back to a lower pitch, creating a palpable sense of harmonic longing intensified by pervasive diminished seventh chords. This tension suddenly gives way to a bright, exuberant theme in A major, now rendered with bold, chordal force and ornate flourishes, its character transformed by the striking shift to a distant key. The music builds to a powerful climax, culminating in a thunderous diminished seventh chord. A restless interlude follows, driven by flowing eighth notes and rhythmic hemiola, initially hovering around E-flat major with a light, scherzando character reminiscent of earlier material, then surging through rising sequences before veering unexpectedly into the dark, remote key of F-sharp minor. A stepwise descending bass line guides the harmony back toward E-flat major, which is firmly reestablished—only to briefly flicker into its minor mode. The return of the second theme in its original key is marked by greater intensity and assertiveness, before the music slips back into the shadow of G minor at the close.
