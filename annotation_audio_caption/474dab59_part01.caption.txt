A bold, balanced theme unfolds in a bright, stable home key, beginning with a four-bar phrase that pauses with a sense of anticipation, followed by another that resolves more firmly but still away from the home key. This is succeeded by a sustained harmonic tension over a repeating bass note, leading into a restatement of the opening idea, now reshaped to settle securely into the home key. A new lyrical idea then emerges, still in the same bright tonality, but soon begins to shift upward, arriving at a brighter, more expectant tonal center. There, a graceful melodic phrase appears and is immediately heard twice more, each time with subtle variation, followed by a flowing sequence that builds momentum through layered harmonic tension, setting the stage for the return of the opening theme. That familiar theme reappears, now enriched with fresh details each time it sounds.
