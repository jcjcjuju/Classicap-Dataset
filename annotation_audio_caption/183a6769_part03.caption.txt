A bold, energetic theme—originally heard at the opening—is now presented in the unexpected, mellow key of F major, creating a striking and rare tonal shift that feels both familiar and freshly colored. This is followed by an expanded transitional passage, whose melodic lines are flipped upside down and extended, guiding the music through a winding harmonic path that ultimately settles into the bright, stable home key of C major. There, a lyrical, singing second theme returns with a sense of resolution and warmth, now firmly anchored in the tonic. The section closes with a brief, conclusive codetta that wraps up the musical thought with finality.
