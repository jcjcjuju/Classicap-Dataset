A new, episodic melody unfolds in a somber D minor, soon shifting through A minor and settling into E minor for much of its course. This passage weaves in subtle echoes of earlier themes, with its latter portion drawing rhythmic energy from the first subject’s sixteenth-note motion and melodic contours from the second subject’s middle section. A sustained dominant pedal emerges, under which the musical lines invert, adding textural contrast. Striking harmonic color appears with the tense, exotic sonority of the German sixth chord in E minor. The music then recalls the closing gesture of the second subject, now heard in E minor, D minor, and C major, followed by a brief sequence that spins outward from its final notes. As the development draws to a close, fragments of the second subject’s rhythms intertwine in varied combinations, sometimes with inverted voices, culminating in a dramatic chromatic descent that lands on a suspenseful half cadence in the dark-toned G minor.
