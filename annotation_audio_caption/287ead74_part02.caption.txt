The music begins with a brief echo of the opening idea from the exposition, then quickly moves into new harmonic territory. Starting in A flat major, it soon shifts to the darker, more unsettled sound of B flat minor. Over the course of eight bars, the harmony grows increasingly restless, culminating in a pause on a G major chord that creates a strong sense of anticipation—this chord acts as a gateway, pointing clearly toward C minor and setting up the return of the main theme.
