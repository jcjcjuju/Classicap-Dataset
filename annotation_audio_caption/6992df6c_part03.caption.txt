A bold, energetic theme returns, now richly varied and extended, with its initial phrase accompanied by swirling arpeggios reminiscent of earlier passagework. Its second phrase unfolds not in the expected home key but in a warmer, contrasting tonality, before a striking shift—through enharmonic reinterpretation—launches the music into a bright, distant key. From there, the same arpeggiated passage reappears, now transposed and guiding the harmony back toward the home tonality. A gentler, six-bar melody follows, preserved in character but now grounded in the stable home key. The movement concludes with a closing section that echoes its earlier counterpart, briefly introduces a new lyrical idea, recalls the arpeggiated passagework once more, and finally settles onto a sustained, resonant pedal tone that reaffirms the home key.
