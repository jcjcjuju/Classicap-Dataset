A somber, lyrical theme unfolds in A minor, establishing a melancholic mood before moving to a more unsettled close in E minor. This material returns later, reshaped to settle firmly back into the home key of A minor. Between these statements, the music shifts through brighter and darker harmonic areas—first to C major, then to D minor—before returning to A minor, all while maintaining the same rhythmic character as the earlier Scherzo section.
