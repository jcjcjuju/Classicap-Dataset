The music opens with a brief introductory gesture before a rhythmically defined theme emerges in F minor, conveying a sense of instability as it concludes on a tense, unresolved chord. This leads into a transitional passage that initially echoes the latter portion of the opening theme, then restates its initial idea transposed to G major, creating a shift in color; this builds momentum through a sustained five-bar emphasis on the dominant seventh chord of C minor, heightening anticipation. The arrival in C minor brings a contrasting second theme—unusually placed in the minor dominant rather than the expected major relative—presented in two clear, self-contained phrases, each ending with a firm sense of closure. The section closes with a short coda that revisits the opening theme’s beginning, offering a fleeting return before the entire exposition repeats.
