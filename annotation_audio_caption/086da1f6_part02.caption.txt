The music begins by elaborating on a brief closing idea from the exposition’s coda, unfolding it into a ten-bar passage that explores its harmonic and melodic potential. A new episode follows, presenting a four-bar phrase that soon reappears transposed into G minor, creating a darker, more plaintive color; this same phrase then returns again, now brightened by a shift to B flat major. The development continues by revisiting the coda’s final two bars, now heard in both B flat major and its parallel minor, with shifting harmonies that wander through episodic modulations before finally settling onto a clear dominant chord that strongly points toward D major.
