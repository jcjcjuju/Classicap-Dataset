A bold, stable theme in D major is heard, followed by a slightly altered version of the same theme now sounding brighter and more tense as it shifts to A major. This entire span returns with subtle changes, reinforcing the initial ideas. The music then moves into a passage that unfolds through sequential repetition: a short phrase is restated first in A major, then again in the darker, more plaintive key of B minor, building momentum until it lands on a dissonant, unresolved chord that creates strong anticipation. Finally, the opening theme reappears in its original D major, now subtly reshaped and extended, bringing the section to a clear and settled close in the home key.
