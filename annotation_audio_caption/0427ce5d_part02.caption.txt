A gently syncopated note, C, pulses in broken octaves, bridging the home key to a new tonal area. A lyrical main theme emerges in F major, its rhythm subtly offbeat and its harmonies enriched by ornamental dissonances that resolve smoothly. This theme sequences toward C major, where bright triads are momentarily shadowed by a tense, diminished chord. The syncopation intensifies as the music pivots into F minor, launching a darker continuation of the theme. Fleeting returns to the original major key give way to a somber journey through minor tonalities, culminating in a surprising brightening—a C major chord that hints at resolution without fully arriving. A sustained dominant note underpins growing urgency, leading to a heightened restatement of earlier material with fuller chords and deeper expressiveness, now remaining firmly in the minor mode with subtle chromatic inflections. The intensity suddenly softens as a new, calmer idea appears in D flat major before slipping back into F minor, hovering over its dominant chord. A brief, recurring motive weaves through this harmonic suspense, eventually guiding the music through shifting keys—first to the stability of A flat major, then onward to C major. Finally, the main theme returns in its original form, beginning warmly in F major and once again finding its way to a clear, open C major.
