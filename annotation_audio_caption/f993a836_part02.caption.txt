The music shifts to a new, contrasting episode in A flat major, introducing fresh melodic material with a distinct tonal color. This section unfolds and concludes with a clear arrival point, after which the texture evolves into passages built over a sustained dominant pedal point, echoing motives from the episode. The harmony intensifies with this pedal, creating anticipation before resolving firmly to the home key with a strong, conclusive cadence just as the bold, energetic character of the opening theme reappears.
