The music begins with a somber, searching character in G minor, drawing from the opening gesture of the introduction—a stark, modulatory idea that feels unsettled and exploratory. The second of these introductory bars is immediately echoed, deepening the sense of instability. As this material unfolds, the harmony shifts with a striking twist: a note spelled as E flat is reinterpreted as D sharp, pivoting the music into the darker, more intense key of E minor. Fragments reminiscent of the introduction return twice more, each time distilling its restless, harmonically wandering essence into brief, haunting echoes that thread through the ongoing development.
