A bold, stately theme in E flat major unfolds, establishing a stable tonal center before pausing with a sense of anticipation on the dominant harmony. This is followed by a second theme that grows directly out of the first, maintaining the same key and reinforcing the opening mood with related melodic shapes. The entire section then returns from the second theme onward, presenting this derived material once more before concluding.
