A bold, energetic theme returns, now reshaped with fresh detail yet still rooted in its original key. This leads into a transitional passage that echoes earlier material but unfolds differently, shifting from a bright major tonality toward a warm, stable resolution in the home key’s major mode. A lyrical second theme follows, its melody now glowing in the major version of the home key, transformed from its earlier form but retaining its graceful contour. The music then moves into a closing section that recalls both main themes, weaving them together as the harmony brightens through a series of sharpening key signatures, ultimately anchoring itself in the home key with a final, radiant major chord.
