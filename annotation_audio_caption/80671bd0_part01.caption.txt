A bold, angular theme in F sharp minor begins in the alto, soon answered in the treble with a version that shifts toward C sharp minor, creating a sense of harmonic tension. A brief codetta bridges back to F sharp minor before the theme resurfaces in the bass. This gives way to a restless interlude built from fragments of the opening idea, twisting through keys until the answer reappears in the bass in C sharp minor, followed by the original theme in the treble back in F sharp minor. A new, more expansive episode unfolds with a fresh imitative idea introduced in the bass, winding through distant tonal areas before the theme returns in B minor in the alto. Another transitional passage blends motifs from earlier, leading to the answer in the bass in C sharp minor. A lengthy, inventive episode follows, introducing entirely new material that is imitated and inverted across the voices while fragments of the main theme flicker throughout, steering the harmony through a rich sequence of keys toward B minor. The theme then reemerges twice—first in the alto in B minor, then in the treble in F sharp minor—before a final transitional passage ushers in the answer once more in the bass in C sharp minor. The music settles briefly with echoes of the theme in the upper parts over a flowing bass line, leading to a final, clear statement of the theme in the treble in F sharp minor, which resolves into a quiet, conclusive coda that reaffirms the home key.
