A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, presenting its initial six-bar phrase ending with a sense of pause, then restated and extended to eight bars for a full resolution. This is followed by a contrasting quiet, song-like passage where a gentle motive is heard three times in quick succession. A transition begins with a striking, dissonant chord and moves through shifting harmonies from G minor to F major, echoing the earlier modulation but transposed. The lyrical second subject reappears now rooted in the home minor key, concluding its first part with a bright major inflection, then unfolding a longer, flowing continuation in the major mode with ornamental sixteenth-note figures reminiscent of the opening theme. Finally, the music revisits a previously omitted reflective section—featuring a brief turn toward a darker key, a return to stability, and a sustained grounding on the home chord—to bring the movement to a close.
