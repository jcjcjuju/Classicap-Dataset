The music begins with a lyrical, flowing passage reminiscent of the earlier transition, now transposed and slightly expanded, unfolding in a rich sequence of shifting tonal centers—from a warm D flat major through increasingly tense minor keys—before settling on a suspenseful pause in G minor. This gives way to a focused exploration of the second subject’s opening idea, first presented in full with its bold arpeggiated contours, then gradually distilled into a persistent, restless stream of eighth notes. The material is restated and transformed: first anchored in G minor before pivoting to C minor, then heard again with the musical lines flipped upside down, now grounded in C minor and shifting to F minor. A cascading sequence follows, descending through brighter E flat major and back into C minor, before further inversions steer the harmony toward B flat minor. The section culminates in a final reversal of voices, arriving at a strong, unresolved dominant seventh chord in B flat major, charged with anticipation.
