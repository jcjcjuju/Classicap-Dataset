A languid, rising arpeggio opens the theme in G minor, adorned with a gentle upper neighbor note that resolves smoothly downward. The music meanders through fleeting glimpses of brighter harmonic colors—briefly touching on the relative major and the subdominant minor—yet always returns to the somber stability of G minor. Rich harmonic textures unfold with expressive dissonances: chords tinged with sevenths, sudden sharp tensions from secondary dominants and diminished harmonies, and suspensions that ache before resolving. Near the end of the theme, a flourish of vocal-like ornamentation adds lyrical intensity before the music settles into a conclusive cadence. This gives way to an interlude that grows increasingly restless: initial sighing appoggiaturas in both hands repeat with heightened agitation, then intensify further as the bass anchors firmly on the tonic while dissonant passing notes and persistent appoggiaturas create mounting tension. The harmony churns with dominant and diminished colors until it begins to brighten, pivoting through an unexpected augmented chord toward the dominant of B flat major, where the root and fifth pulse insistently, setting up a shift in mood and key.
