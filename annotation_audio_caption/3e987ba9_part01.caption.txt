A bold, balanced theme unfolds in three clear two-bar phrases, establishing a stable home base; this is followed by a brief transitional passage that momentarily brightens through a shift to B-flat major before settling into a new key with a gentle, inverted cadence. A lyrical second theme then emerges in this brighter key, built on a repeating motive whose accompaniment subtly shifts each time, creating a flowing sequence. The music briefly tightens through a skipped bar, then expands with a richly varied return of the same idea, during which the melodic and accompanying roles swap between the hands. The section closes with a short, distinct codetta that gently rounds off the exposition before the music begins again from the start.
