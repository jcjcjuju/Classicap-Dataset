A bold, stepwise theme in C major is first heard in the alto, soon answered in the treble with a subtly altered version that creates a bright, stable contrast in G major. The original theme then returns firmly in the bass, reestablishing C major. This gives way to a flowing passage that shifts harmonically from C toward G, closing securely in that key. The theme reappears in the alto, momentarily suggesting D before settling into a darker D minor, followed by a transformed answer in the treble within A minor. A restless, modulating episode unfolds, weaving through A minor, G, C, and F before arriving back in C major, where the answer sounds in the bass. Another brief episode follows, circling around G, after which the original theme returns clearly in the alto in C major, then answered in the treble while gently steering toward G. A final extended episode begins in G and gradually winds back to C, setting up a closing section where the opening gesture of the theme is restated in descending layers—first in the bass, then the alto, and finally in fragmented form in the treble—before a brief coda brings the movement to a quiet close.
