A bold, balanced theme in E flat major unfolds in two clear, repeated phrases, establishing a stable and grounded tonal center. This is followed by a contrasting episode that begins and ends in the same home key but ventures into a darker, more tense mood with a shift to F minor; within this episode, a four-bar passage returns with subtle variation before the music transitions onward. The opening theme then reappears, now reshaped with fresh detail while retaining its essential character and harmonic foundation.
