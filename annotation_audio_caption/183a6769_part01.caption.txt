A bold, stable theme opens in the home key, establishing a clear sense of tonal center. This gives way to a flowing passage built on sequential patterns that create forward motion and harmonic tension, ultimately leading to a dominant harmony. A contrasting lyrical idea then emerges in a brighter, closely related key, marked by a gentle descending sequence within its span. The section closes with a brief, conclusive gesture that reinforces the new key before the music prepares to begin again.
