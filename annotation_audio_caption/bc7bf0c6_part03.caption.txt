A bold, energetic theme in G major returns, though only partially and without its full continuation. This is followed by a transformed transitional passage that begins with the same opening idea but soon shifts to a brighter, contrasting key, stretching the phrase longer than before. Fragments from the lyrical second theme then emerge, woven into this transition, which ultimately settles back into familiar closing gestures from earlier. The music then presents the full lyrical second subject, now grounded in the home key of G major, bringing a sense of resolution and warmth. This leads directly into a closing section that echoes the second subject’s character, reaffirming the stability of the tonic key to conclude the movement.
