A bold, balanced theme unfolds in the home key, structured in clear two-bar segments that form two four-bar phrases; the second phrase briefly shifts toward a related minor key, creating a fleeting sense of departure before returning to stability. This material then returns with variation, preserving its essential shape while altering surface details. Flowing sixteenth-note patterns, drawn from the opening theme, drive a transition that remains mostly in the home key before pivoting decisively to a brighter, closely related key. There, a new melody emerges—its opening gesture echoing the initial theme but now cast in this new tonal light and enriched by tightly woven imitation, with one voice closely following another at the octave. This gives way to a lyrical passage of uneven phrase lengths, where the second idea gently reshapes the first, creating a subtle sense of development within songlike contours. The section closes with a brief, compact wrap-up that echoes earlier motifs, preparing for what follows.
