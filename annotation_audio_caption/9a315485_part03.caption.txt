A bold, energetic theme in C minor returns, now reshaped and prolonged, preserving its initial character while unfolding with greater elaboration. This material, originally heard at the movement’s outset, is followed by a passage derived from it—a developmental episode that weaves rhythmic and motivic fragments into a more expansive fabric. The music ultimately settles back into the home key of C minor with a sense of finality. A concluding section then emerges, offering a reflective yet decisive close that reinforces the tonic with quiet resolution.
