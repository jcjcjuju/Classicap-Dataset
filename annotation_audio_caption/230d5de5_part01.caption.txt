A bright, clear theme emerges in the upper voice in G major, followed by a brief transitional passage that shifts the harmony toward D major. The theme then returns in the middle voice, now adjusted to fit the new key, without any accompanying counter-melody, and another short transition guides the music back to G major. The same theme is next heard in the lowest voice, firmly rooted in G major, before a final transitional passage leads to a close in D major. A developmental episode unfolds with restless harmonic motion, weaving through D major, G major, A minor, and finally settling into E minor, where the main theme reappears in the bass. Another brief transition moves the music to B minor, where the adjusted version of the theme is stated in the upper voice. A second, extended episode follows, gradually working its way back through shifting harmonies until it arrives at G major, setting the stage for the theme’s return in the middle voice, now restored to its original key. The movement concludes with a short, stable closing passage in G major.
