A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, presenting a stable and confident opening idea that concludes with a strong sense of resolution. This is followed by an extended transitional passage that unfolds with greater elaboration than before, gradually guiding the music toward a return of the contrasting second theme—now heard not in the dominant but firmly in the tonic key, slightly expanded and subtly reshaped. A sustained pedal tone then emerges, anchoring a brief interlude that echoes earlier linking material, creating a moment of harmonic stillness before giving way to an unexpected and virtuosic cadenza. Within this soloistic display, fragments of the main theme and the earlier linking figures are woven together with intricate figuration, including inverted textures, melodic sequences over a drone, and shifting harmonies, all culminating in dazzling scale runs. The main theme reappears once more, though only in part, seamlessly flowing into a closing section that first recalls a fragment of the second theme—varied and reiterated—and then brings the movement to a close with final echoes of the principal idea.
