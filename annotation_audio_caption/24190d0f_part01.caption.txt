A bold, stepwise theme in E major begins in the lowest voice, soon answered in the tenor with a brighter, related version in B major while the bass introduces a flowing counter-melody. The theme then passes to the alto, now back in E major, with the tenor taking up the counter-melody, followed by a high, clear statement of the answer in the soprano over the alto’s counterpoint in B major. A brief transitional passage weaves fragments of the counter-melody through shifting harmonies, moving from E toward B. The answer returns in the alto without its usual companion, quickly overlapped by a tight layering of the original theme in the tenor, then the bass, and finally the treble, all in E major, with the tenor supplying the counter-melody beneath the top voice. A new episode unfolds with a rhythmic figure and suspended notes passed among the voices, steering the harmony through F-sharp minor to a close in C-sharp minor. The theme reappears in the alto in this darker key, followed by a high, unaccompanied answer in E major that overlaps with nothing. After a pause, the theme returns in the bass in B major, immediately followed by another overlapping answer in the tenor within F-sharp minor, again without counterpoint. A longer episode emerges, echoing the theme in fragmented, quicker rhythms, eventually arriving back in C-sharp minor. The theme then resurfaces in the treble, halved in note values, and is swiftly imitated in diminution by the alto, tenor, and bass across shifting tonal centers—E major, then B major—with no counter-melody present. The full-length theme returns in the alto, leading into a final episode that drifts toward G-sharp minor and settles there. The music then circles back to E major as the alto gives the answer while the tenor presents the theme upside-down and in quicker notes; simultaneously, the treble reintroduces the original counter-melody. Overlapping entries intensify: the tenor states the theme while the treble sustains the counter-melody, the bass answers as the alto echoes the counter-melody in B major, and the treble sings the theme once more with the tenor underneath in counterpoint. A short closing phrase firmly establishes E major, followed by a final bass answer with alto counterpoint in B major, and
