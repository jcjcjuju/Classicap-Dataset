A bold, energetic theme unfolds in four phrases, with its melodic shape first heard in the upper voice and then mirrored in the lower, while the bass line’s original pattern rises to the treble in alternation—creating a clear interplay between voices. This initial material moves toward a darker, more introspective tonal area before giving way to a section of harmonic searching, where the music shifts through various keys until a familiar theme reappears, now settled in a warmer, closely related key. The opening idea then returns once more, gradually distilled into simpler textures, underpinned by a persistent, resonant bass note that reinforces a sense of growing stability, leading into an extended closing passage that gently narrows the musical focus until the piece comes to rest.
