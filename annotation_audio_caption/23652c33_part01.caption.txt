A bold, stable theme in B flat major unfolds in two parts: the first feels like a clear opening statement, and the second answers it with rising energy that lands on a tense, unresolved chord before returning to reaffirm the home key with a strong, satisfying close. This is followed by a restless transitional passage built from a short two-bar idea that echoes three times with shifting harmonic colors, then a stark, unison line that builds anticipation before recalling the rhythm of the opening theme to pivot toward a brighter key. A sustained dominant harmony of G major sets the stage for a new melody that emerges subtly within the middle voices, its opening notes seamlessly borrowed from the bass line just heard. This lyrical idea repeats with a shift toward a darker, minor inflection, then embarks on a winding journey through a series of keys, each step echoing the previous in a cascading sequence. After settling briefly in G major, the music veers toward D major, then revisits this material an octave higher before spiraling through another sequence that lands in C major, where a fresh motif appears momentarily before yielding to a final, gentle return to G major. The section closes with a new, self-contained idea that is immediately restated with variation, followed by a harmonically charged passage that resolves not to the expected home key but to G major, setting up a brief lead-in that loops back to the beginning.
