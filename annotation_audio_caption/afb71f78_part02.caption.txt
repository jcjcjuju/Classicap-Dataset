The music begins with a bold, familiar theme now cast in a darker, more tense key, immediately followed by a passage that reshapes its melodic figures into new, restless shapes. This leads through a fleeting moment of brightness in a major key before shifting through richly colored harmonies—marked by a striking chromatic chord—that guide the ear into a somber minor key and then into a warmer, more lyrical major one, where a distinct, song-like episode unfolds. After this, the music turns again, moving through shadowy minor keys before briefly recalling a flowing, ornamental idea from earlier. It then settles into a sustained, expectant harmony that builds tension until a dazzling flourish—crafted from inverted echoes of earlier transitional material—propels the music forward with energy and clarity toward what comes next.
