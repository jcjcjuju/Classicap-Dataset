A shortened version of the bold, four-note opening theme returns in the home key, sounding familiar yet more concise. This leads into a transitional passage that begins with a fragment of the theme’s closing idea, then shifts harmonically toward B-flat major; soon after, the same four-note rhythm emerges in the bass within a darker B-flat minor context, and the music continues with expanded harmonic activity before settling on a sustained dominant chord. The two-note theme—now heard in the stable home key instead of a distant one—enters with subtle melodic adjustments, offering a sense of resolution. An extended closing section follows, featuring a prolonged dominant pedal in the bass that later spreads to the upper voices, after which the original four-note theme reappears clearly. The movement concludes with a swift chromatic scale and a firm, conclusive cadence built from the rhythm of that opening motif.
