After a brief two-bar introduction, a new lyrical episode unfolds in A flat major, offering a contrasting tonal color and mood. This extended passage gradually gives way to an intense and active section where musical ideas are fragmented, recombined, and driven through shifting harmonic landscapes, creating a sense of exploration and tension before resolving into the return of familiar material.
