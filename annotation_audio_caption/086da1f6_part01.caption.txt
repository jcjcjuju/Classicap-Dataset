A bold, structured theme in F major unfolds in three balanced four-bar segments, establishing a stable and clear tonal center. This material briefly returns at the outset of a transitional passage, now colored by a striking harmonic twist—an augmented sixth chord that creates tension through its repeated resolutions to a dominant A, setting up an unexpected shift toward C major. In this new key, a lyrical second subject emerges in three successive four-bar phrases, the last of which pivots smoothly into G major, where alternating tonic and dominant harmonies build momentum. A somber variation follows in C minor, introduced by a tense, dissonant diminished seventh chord on F sharp, which gives way to a fresh four-bar idea. The music then recalls a triplet rhythm from earlier, guiding the passage to a decisive and conclusive cadence in C major. The section closes with a reflective coda: a four-bar phrase returns with subtle alterations and extended phrasing, culminating in a peculiar harmonic blend—a diminished seventh chord layered over a sustained dominant bass note—before the entire exposition repeats.
