A bold, lyrical theme in E major unfolds in two balanced phrases: the first settles firmly into the home key, while the second shifts brightly toward B major. Just as a third phrase seems about to begin, it halts abruptly, giving way to a dramatic episode that opens with a sharp, dissonant chord. This passage quickly transforms into a free-flowing, cadenza-like flourish, moving from the dark hues of C sharp minor to the somber tones of B minor. The opening theme then returns, now transposed to B major and reshaped—its original melody implied only through rhythm and reworked in the bass. A new, expressive melody emerges over this familiar rhythmic foundation, starting in the shadowy key of G sharp minor. Tension builds through a sustained, inverted pedal point that drives toward a restatement of the main theme, now modified and underpinned by a rising scale in the bass, steering the music back toward the stability of E major—only to be cut off once more by an abrupt interruption.
