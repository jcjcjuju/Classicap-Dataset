A bold, lyrical theme returns in the home key, now adorned with subtle embellishments that add gentle ornamentation without altering its essential character. This is followed by a contrasting second theme, also enriched with decorative flourishes, now grounded firmly in the tonic key rather than the dominant, lending it a warmer, more resolved quality. The passage closes with a brief, quiet codetta that lingers on the home chord, offering a sense of calm closure.
