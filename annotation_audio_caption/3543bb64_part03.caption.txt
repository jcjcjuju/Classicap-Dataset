A bold, energetic theme in F minor returns exactly as first heard, beginning mid-measure with a distinct rhythmic drive and ending with a sense of harmonic tension. This is followed by a transitional passage that closely mirrors the earlier connecting material, now reshaped to guide the harmony back toward the home key. A contrasting lyrical theme then unfolds in the same F minor, subtly altered in its details but retaining its two-part structure and conclusive cadences. The movement closes with a final statement drawn from the opening of the main theme, varied in its presentation yet clearly echoing its initial character.
