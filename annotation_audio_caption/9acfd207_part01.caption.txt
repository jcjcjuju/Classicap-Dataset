A bold, angular theme emerges in the alto, establishing a somber mood in D sharp minor. It is answered in the tenor with a transposed version that shifts the tonal center to A sharp minor, accompanied by a contrasting counter-melody in the alto. A brief codetta bridges back to D sharp minor, leading to the theme’s return in the bass, now paired with the counter-melody in the tenor. The answer then appears in the treble, supported by the counter-subject in the bass, again in A sharp minor. A flowing episode follows, weaving through shifting tonalities—A sharp minor, D sharp major, and G sharp minor—before an altered version of the answer enters in the bass, its contour subtly lowered to settle in G sharp minor, with a fragment of the counter-melody above. The theme reappears twice more in altered form, first in the alto in F sharp major without counterpoint, then in the tenor in G sharp minor with only a hint of the original counter-subject in the bass. The unaltered theme returns clearly in the treble, firmly in D sharp minor, with the full counter-subject in the tenor. This is followed by a tight stretto where the opening gesture of the theme overlaps in the tenor, still in G sharp minor. The theme then unfolds successively in the bass (D sharp minor), treble (C sharp minor), alto (F sharp major), and tenor (G sharp minor, again altered), each entry distinct in register and key. A second episode unfolds, modulating from D sharp minor through A sharp minor and back, before the theme resurfaces in the bass with homophonic support, reaffirming D sharp minor. A short codetta solidifies this tonal center, leading to a final presentation where the theme sounds in the treble while its inverted answer unfolds simultaneously in the tenor, both in D sharp minor. The movement closes with a brief coda.
