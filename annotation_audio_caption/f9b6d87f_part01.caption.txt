A bold, distinctive theme enters in the lowest voice in a bright, stable key, soon answered by a higher voice stating the same theme transposed to a related key, creating a sense of harmonic motion without a supporting counter-melody. Brief connecting passages shift the harmony back and forth between these keys, each time leading to another clear statement of the theme—first in the highest voice, then again in the lowest. The music then begins a journey through darker, more distant tonal areas: a short passage leads into a somber version of the theme in a minor key, followed by another brief transition into an even more remote minor key where the transposed theme appears once more. A flowing, developmental section unfolds with hints of the main theme woven into the upper voices over an independent bass line, eventually guiding the harmony back toward the original key. The theme returns in the bass, slightly reshaped, before another developmental passage explores a neighboring minor key and circles back. The theme appears again in the treble in a new, brighter key, followed by a third developmental stretch that weaves fragments of the theme through all voices while shifting harmonies toward a dominant area. There, a transformed version of the transposed theme sounds in the alto, leading into a final transitional passage that steadily returns to the home key. The movement concludes with a final, subtly varied statement of the main theme in the treble, now firmly grounded in the original bright tonality.
