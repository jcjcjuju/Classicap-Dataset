The music opens with a bold theme in a somber, minor tonality, establishing a stable home base that briefly shifts to a brighter, unexpected key before returning. This theme is then varied and extended, unfolding with renewed energy. A new, rhythmically off-balance idea follows, introduced in a short, distinctive phrase and immediately restated with subtle changes; this idea is further echoed and transformed before giving way to a passage that gradually shifts toward a more luminous, major-key area. There, a lyrical phrase emerges in the low register, built simply from the notes of a major chord, and is promptly echoed higher up; the same phrase returns below with a flowing, triplet-based accompaniment, then again above with the same rippling support. This leads to a rising melodic line in the upper voice, soaring over a deep, resonant bass that gradually draws closer in pitch, culminating in a strong, conclusive cadence in the major key. The movement briefly lingers on this resolution, ending with a gentle, unresolved chord that leaves a sense of quiet suspension.
