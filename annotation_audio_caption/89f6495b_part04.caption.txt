A bold, lyrical theme returns in the home key, unfolding with the same contour and character as at the opening, built from the distinctive three-note “Le-be-wohl” motif. This is followed by a transitional passage of similar shape and length to the earlier one, now subtly reshaped to prepare a return to stability rather than departure. A gentler, more expansive melody then emerges in the same home key, its phrases broadened and warmly resonant. The music culminates in an extended closing section that obsessively transforms the “Le-be-wohl” idea: first stated plainly in single notes, then enriched in harmonized thirds, later interwoven with rapid sixteenth-note figures that shift from below to above, developed in strict canon an octave apart, compressed into quicker rhythms, and finally suspended over a sustained inverted pedal point, creating a luminous, reflective conclusion.
