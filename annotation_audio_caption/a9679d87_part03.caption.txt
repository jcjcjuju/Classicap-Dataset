A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, unfolding with the same six-bar opening and responsive phrases that conclude with a full cadence. This is followed by a bridge passage built entirely of flowing triplets, nearly identical to its earlier appearance, leading smoothly onward. The second theme then reappears, now firmly grounded in the tonic key, beginning in the bass with an arpeggiated figure moving in contrary motion. Its first section is extended by a six-bar interpolation where the opening motif alternates between exact and altered forms—first in the bass, then shifted to the treble—each accompanied by evolving sixteenth-note patterns, all forming a descending sequence that subtly shifts direction near its end. The second section presents a new sixteenth-note idea, repeated sequentially and culminating in a strong cadence. The movement closes with a brief codetta derived from the second subject’s opening gesture, now transposed to the tonic, bringing the section to a clear and stable conclusion.
