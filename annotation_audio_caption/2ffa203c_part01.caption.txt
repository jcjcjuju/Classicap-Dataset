A bold, somber theme in D minor unfolds in two balanced phrases: the first establishes a stable, grounded feeling in the home key, while the second shifts toward a brighter F major before settling into the more restless sound of A minor. This is followed by a passage built over a sustained, tense harmonic drone that creates a sense of anticipation. The opening theme then returns, now reshaped to firmly reestablish the stability of D minor, giving a strong sense of resolution.
