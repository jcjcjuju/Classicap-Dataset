A new musical episode unfolds, introducing fresh melodic and harmonic material unrelated to earlier themes, save for a fleeting echo of the opening gesture. A steady, recurring G anchors the texture as a short ascending sequence builds momentum, accompanied throughout by this persistent tone. Subtle variations of short rhythmic and melodic figures are explored, with one idea briefly mirrored in a slightly altered form. The harmony briefly hints at A minor before navigating a path back toward the home key, first arriving in its bright major mode and then shifting into its darker minor counterpart. A striking, dissonant chord—rich with tension—emerges during this return, momentarily coloring the sound with an unexpected, dramatic flavor before the music continues.
