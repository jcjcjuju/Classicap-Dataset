A burst of fiery energy erupts in a fast, driving passage anchored in G minor. The harmony pulses with urgent chords—the home minor triad, a tense half-diminished seventh, and a strong dominant seventh—creating a restless yet grounded momentum. A distinctive chord with a flattened second scale degree reappears twice, adding a darkly colorful twist amid swirling dominant and diminished harmonies and a bass line that slips chromatically beneath the surface. This harmonic intensity gradually gives way to a prolonged, emphatic alternation between the dominant and tonic chords, reinforcing the home key with growing certainty. Fragments of the movement’s opening theme flash by, transformed by the heightened urgency. The music then plunges into stark, powerful double-octave chromatic scales: first surging upward and downward in opposite directions toward the central tonic pitch, then cascading downward together in unison, before finally settling into a resolute, conclusive G minor chord.
