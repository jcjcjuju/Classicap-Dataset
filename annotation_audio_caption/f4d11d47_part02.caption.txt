The music begins with material drawn from the gentle, lyrical opening of the second subject, now cast in a darker, unsettled mood in C minor. Fragments from an earlier transitional passage—characterized by descending motion and harmonic instability—alternate with this theme, creating a sense of searching and transformation. The harmony shifts restlessly through a series of minor keys, each modulation deepening the tension, until it arrives at D minor, where the passage halts on a sustained dominant chord that feels unexpectedly remote. Throughout, the musical lines continually trade places, flipping register and texture, while striking harmonic colors emerge—the Neapolitan sixth introduces a poignant, flattened inflection, and the Italian sixth chords add sharp, exotic dissonances that heighten the drama before the section comes to its unresolved pause.
