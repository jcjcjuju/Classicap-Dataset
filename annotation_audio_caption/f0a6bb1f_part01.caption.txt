The music opens with a bold, structured theme that unfolds over eight bars and is then extended by a repeated cadential phrase, creating a sense of closure before continuing. A brief transitional passage follows, shifting harmonically from a somber E minor through brighter tonal areas, briefly touching on A major before settling into D major as a point of arrival. In this new key, a lyrical and contrasting melody emerges, marked by graceful contours and a more relaxed character. This is followed by a passage that echoes the opening theme, now reshaped and heard in D major; within this section, a pair of phrases are inverted, creating a mirrored effect. A sequence then unfolds—first presented and then slightly altered—carrying the music through a series of fleeting harmonic shifts: a touch of B minor’s melancholy, the warmth of G major, and a return to E minor’s shadow, all before circling back to a firm and conclusive cadence in D major. The opening theme then returns, subtly embellished, retaining its essential shape but with small ornamental changes that add freshness to its familiar sound.
