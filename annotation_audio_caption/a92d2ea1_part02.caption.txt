The second part opens with a brief introductory passage, followed by a concise, two-bar theme in B-flat major that is immediately answered by its inversion. This leads into a second theme presented in a strict canon at the octave, unfolding in the dominant key of F major with one voice closely shadowing the other. The music then moves into a developmental section that continues the canonic texture, initially drawing on material from the earlier inversion and later introducing a fresh melodic idea. The opening theme of this part returns in its original key, now sustained above a steady, high-pitched pedal tone. The canonic second theme reappears once more, but this time it begins in the lower voice rather than the upper. The section concludes with a transitional passage that first echoes the rhythm of the introduction and then revisits a previous dominant-pedal passage, creating a sense of anticipation for what follows.
