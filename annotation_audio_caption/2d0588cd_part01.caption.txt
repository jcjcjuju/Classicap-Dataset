A bright, stable melody unfolds in A major, coming to a clear and resolved close. This is followed by a new four-bar idea that briefly shifts toward the brighter, more expectant sound of E major, creating a gentle sense of departure. The music then returns to a familiar phrase from the opening melody, reaffirming the home key before a short, rising three-note link—A sharp, B, B sharp—creates a moment of tension and upward pull, leading away from the established tonality.
