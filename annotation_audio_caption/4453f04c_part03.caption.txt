A bold, energetic theme in G major returns, now paired with a fresh accompaniment that gives it a renewed character. This theme is immediately followed by a varied version of itself, transformed with noticeable changes in its musical details while retaining its essential shape. The movement then draws to a close with a coda that continually echoes fragments of this same theme, weaving its familiar contours into a final, cohesive conclusion.
