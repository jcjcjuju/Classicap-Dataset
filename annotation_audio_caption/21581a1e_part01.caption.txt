A bold, angular theme in D sharp minor is first heard in the alto, answered by a higher, tonally adjusted version in the treble that shifts toward A sharp minor, followed by a brief closing gesture. The theme returns in the bass, reaffirming the home key. A passage of chromatically descending bass notes supports intricate, florid lines above, leading to another answer now in the bass in D sharp minor. A modulating episode weaves through related keys before the subject reappears in close succession between alto and treble, creating a tightly overlapping texture. This imitative intensity continues as the subject enters in all three voices with slight alterations, then again in F sharp major with a matching answer in the alto. The theme is then heard upside-down for the first time, still in F sharp major, followed by a second episode that shifts from D sharp minor to G sharp minor. The inverted subject resurfaces in the alto and then the bass, both in D sharp minor, punctuated by short codettas. An altered version of the original theme appears in the treble, immediately followed by its inversion in the bass, then in stretto form in the treble and alto across shifting tonal centers, with fragments echoing above. Further stretti unfold with strict canonic imitation at the octave and with all voices presenting the inverted subject. The original theme returns plainly in treble and alto in D sharp minor, then in the bass stretched out in longer note values, while the treble counters with an inverted answer in G sharp minor. The music moves through F sharp major and the remote B sharp major with statements of the subject and answer, before a final codetta. In the closing section, the subject appears in the bass and altered form in the alto in D sharp minor, while the treble presents it in augmented rhythm; the movement ends with a quiet coda that resolves to a bright major chord.
