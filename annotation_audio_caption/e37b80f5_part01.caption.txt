The music opens with a restless, agitated theme that moves in a chromatic descent, establishing a tense atmosphere in C sharp minor. This gives way to a bold and dramatic main theme, also in C sharp minor, which unfolds through a series of modulations—first brightening into E major, then shifting through F sharp minor and B major before arriving at the distant, resonant key of A flat major. A contrasting section follows, slower and hymn-like, with the character of a chorale in D flat major. This lyrical idea briefly moves to the warmer but still remote G flat major before returning to its original form, now restated with the melody lifted to a higher octave, lending it a more luminous quality.
