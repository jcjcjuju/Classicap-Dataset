The music opens with two forceful, jarring chords that immediately establish a mood of tension and unease. A bold, agitated main theme follows in B minor, anchored by a steady bass note that reinforces a sense of gravity; this gives way to a related passage in E minor, still driven by a persistent bass tone that creates forward momentum. The music then returns firmly to B minor, now underpinned by a dominant pedal that builds suspense, intensified by frequent dissonant harmonies and fleeting chromatic notes that add sharp color without shifting the key. A quieter interlude emerges, marked by sudden bursts of loud intensity, ultimately resolving into a clear, conclusive cadence. The mood then shifts to a restless, driving section that unfolds through a series of harmonic sequences, briefly touching on brighter keys—D major, F-sharp minor, A major—before moving through darker, more unstable harmonies involving augmented sixth chords and minor dominants. This leads into a contrasting episode in F-sharp major, where a flattened sixth introduces a bittersweet inflection, punctuated by strong cadences. The music eventually circles back to B minor, winding down with a sustained dominant harmony and ornamental flourishes built on tense, fragmented diminished chords. The main theme returns with its original dramatic character, followed again by the softer interlude, now slightly expanded and left unresolved on a dominant tone, heightening anticipation.
