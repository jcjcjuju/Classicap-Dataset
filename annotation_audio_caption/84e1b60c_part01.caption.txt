A bold, angular subject emerges in the alto, establishing a somber mood in B minor, soon answered in the tenor with a version adjusted to fit the key of F sharp minor, accompanied by a flowing counterpoint in the alto. A brief codetta provides a momentary pause before the subject returns in the bass, now back in B minor, with the tenor supplying the counter-subject. The answer then appears in the treble, again in F sharp minor, supported by the counter-subject in the bass. This gives way to a modulating episode built from fragments of earlier material, briefly touching on F sharp before returning to B minor, with a fleeting three-note hint of the subject in the alto. The full subject reappears in the alto, now firmly in B minor, paired with the counter-subject in the treble. A second episode unfolds, shifting through F sharp minor and B before settling into E minor, punctuated by a short echo of the answer in the tenor. The subject enters in the tenor in E minor, its counter-subject subtly reshaped in the treble. An incomplete stretto follows, with the subject overlapping in the alto and treble without the usual counterpoint. The subject then sounds alone in the treble in B minor, before returning in the bass with the counter-subject in the treble. A dense, complete stretto begins as the opening gesture of the subject is passed rapidly through treble, alto, and bass, each entry shifting to a new key—B minor, E minor, A major—and culminating in the tenor stating the full subject in D major, joined by part of the counter-subject in the alto. The answer then appears in the bass in D major, with the counter-subject in the treble, leading into another modulating episode that winds from D toward F sharp minor. The subject returns in the tenor with its counter-subject in F sharp minor, then again in the bass, now in the brighter key of E major, still with the counter-subject above. It appears once more in the tenor in B minor, this time without the counter-subject. A final episode, similar in construction to earlier ones, modulates from F sharp minor back to B minor, setting up a fragment of the subject in the tenor, immediately followed by an incomplete stretto between bass and treble in E minor. The movement closes with a coda in
