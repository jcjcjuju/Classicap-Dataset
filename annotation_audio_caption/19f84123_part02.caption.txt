The music begins with a bold, energetic theme—originally rooted in the home key—now heard in a brighter, more distant tonality that creates a sense of departure and tension. This thematic material unfolds with a steady harmonic foundation, evoking the character of the opening idea but colored by its new key. Later, fragments of a contrasting transitional passage emerge, marked by flowing arpeggios and a shift to an even more remote tonal area, introducing a darker, richer hue that deepens the sense of exploration and instability.
