A bold, energetic theme establishes a stable home base, unfolding with a sustained harmonic tension as a repeating bass note underpins its middle portion, while upper melodic lines flip their roles in a subtle exchange of voices. This theme is immediately echoed an octave higher, then again in the low register alone over a rich, expectant chord that signals a shift in tonal center. A new, lyrical melody emerges in this brighter key, its phrases unfolding in a stepwise sequence with intertwining voices that cross over each other, momentarily colored by a striking, exotic-sounding chord that adds a touch of dramatic flair. The music then flows seamlessly into a brief, transitional passage that recalls the opening theme’s character, using its shape to pivot harmonically and prepare the way forward.
