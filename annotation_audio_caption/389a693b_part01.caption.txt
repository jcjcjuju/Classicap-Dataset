The music opens with a bright, stable theme in G major that soon shifts through a series of key changes—first to the brighter D major, then to the more distant F major, and onward to C major—before returning firmly to G major with a conclusive cadence. This is followed by a transitional passage that echoes the closing gesture of the opening theme, then reintroduces an earlier melodic idea, building tension as it moves toward a dominant harmony; within this buildup, a fleeting reminder of the initial theme appears, now steering the music toward the dominant of B major. A new lyrical idea then unfolds in the unexpected key of B major, later echoed in the lower register with a darker, minor inflection. This gives way to a flowing series of sequential patterns that wander through multiple tonal centers. The section closes with a short, repeated two-bar figure that alternates between B minor and B major, finally settling into B minor as the figure becomes more urgent, compressed into single-bar statements until the end.
