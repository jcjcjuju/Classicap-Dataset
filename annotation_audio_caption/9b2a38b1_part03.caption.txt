The music returns to the bold, energetic theme in A major, first heard at the opening, with its two clear phrases—one creating a sense of forward motion by ending with tension, the other resolving firmly to a stable home base. This is followed by a restless, harmonically shifting passage that briefly settles into a darker, minor-key episode before a series of driving, dissonant chords propel the music back to the bright A major tonality. The main theme then reappears in full, reaffirming its lively character, and the section closes with a brief, decisive coda that echoes the opening idea, bringing clarity and closure.
