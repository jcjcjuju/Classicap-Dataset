A bold, angular theme originally heard in shifting minor and major modes now returns in the darker, unsettled sound of F minor. This gives way to a transitional passage that echoes earlier material, winding through distant harmonies before settling into the warm, stable brightness of F major. A lyrical, contrasting melody—previously presented in a major key related to the dominant—now unfolds in this same F major, offering a sense of calm resolution. The music then flows seamlessly into a brief, anticipatory passage that dissolves any final cadence, carrying the listener directly into the next movement without pause.
