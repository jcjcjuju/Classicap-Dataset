The music unfolds with fragments derived from the opening theme and the closing gestures of the codetta, reshaped through intricate layers of imitation. A low voice echoes a higher one at the octave, entering a full measure later, creating a resonant, overlapping dialogue; shortly after, the roles reverse, with the upper voice now shadowing the lower at the octave, but entering halfway through the measure, producing a tighter, more urgent interplay. Voices frequently invert their roles, trading melodic and accompanying functions, while the harmony shifts restlessly through a sequence of distant keys—A minor, B-flat major, G minor, and onward—each transition coloring the texture with new tension and color. This harmonic journey culminates in a sustained double dominant pedal that anchors a rising chromatic line, building intensity until it dissolves into a swift, descending stream of sixteenth notes that flows directly into the return of the main theme.
