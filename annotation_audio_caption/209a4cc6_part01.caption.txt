A bold theme begins not in the home key but in a brighter, related key, soon settling into a stable, grounded tonality; this theme is then restated with subtle variation. A flowing episode follows, built from the rhythmic and melodic shape of the opening idea, unfolding in a series of echoing patterns. The main theme returns, now heard low in the bass with a light, continuous stream of eighth notes above; it then shifts upward to the treble, with the same fluid accompaniment now pulsing below. The section closes with a brief coda that wraps up the musical thought before the music circles back to the episode.
