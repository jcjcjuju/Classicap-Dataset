A new section unfolds in a darker, minor mode, built from a transformed version of the main theme heard earlier—its opening now turned upside down and paired with a fresh, quick-moving sixteenth-note pattern in the upper voice. This idea returns immediately with the musical lines flipped again, creating a subtle play of inversion. The music then moves toward a moment of unresolved tension, emphasized by a striking, dissonant chord that pulls the ear toward a temporary pause; this pause is extended and intensified before the earlier material returns, reshaped once more with the inverted lines now swapped again. Throughout, unexpected harmonic colors emerge—first a haunting, flattened chord that briefly shifts the music through a distant key, and later another tense, expansive chord that heightens the sense of anticipation. The entire episode finally settles with a strong, conclusive cadence in the minor key. A brief transition follows, its harmony winding upward to a dominant seventh chord that creates a clear sense of expectation for what comes next.
