A lyrical melody unfolds in two balanced sections, each made of two clear four-bar phrases that resolve with a strong sense of closure on the home chord. Midway through the first section, a striking harmonic twist introduces a tense, dissonant color—created by a German augmented sixth chord—that momentarily pulls the harmony away from stability before resolving. The entire structure is symmetrical and grounded, with each phrase ending decisively, reinforcing the tonal center through full, satisfying cadences.
