A bold, rhythmic figure of four repeated C’s opens the music in a bright F major, immediately establishing a clear and stable home tonality. This distinctive motif is soon echoed and developed throughout the first section, which then shifts to a brighter, more assertive C major, creating a sense of harmonic motion and contrast. The second section begins with a sudden turn to the darker, more introspective sound of G minor, introducing a feeling of gentle tension. From there, the music explores a warmer, more expansive B flat major before gradually winding its way back toward the reassuring stability of F major. Both sections close with nearly identical cadential gestures, giving the impression of a balanced, symmetrical design that feels both purposeful and satisfying to the ear.
