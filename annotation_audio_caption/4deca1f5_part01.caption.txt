A bold, self-contained theme in E flat major begins the movement, establishing a stable and resolved tonal center; this opening idea, characterized by a clear cadence, is immediately heard again in full. It is followed by a contrasting continuation that remains in the same key but introduces a distinctly different character. A transitional passage then emerges, shifting briefly into the minor mode of the home key before unfolding new material that moves toward the dominant key, where it settles with a sense of arrival. A lyrical second theme follows in this dominant key (B flat major), built primarily from the notes of its tonic chord and echoing the rhythmic shape of the earlier contrasting section. The exposition closes with a sustained harmonic tension, as the dominant seventh chord is prolonged, creating a sense of anticipation that leads back to the beginning for a repeat.
