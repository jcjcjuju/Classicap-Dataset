A bold, angular theme emerges in the alto, rooted in C minor, soon answered in the treble with a slightly altered version that shifts the tonal center toward G minor, accompanied by a winding counter-melody in the alto. This gives way to a brief codetta where fragments of the theme and its counterpoint ascend together in sequence, steering the harmony back to C minor. The theme then resurfaces in the bass, now paired with the counter-melody in the treble. A series of interludes follows, each built from motives of the theme or its counterpoint: the first cascades downward through the voices while shifting to E-flat major; the second features flowing lines derived from the counter-melody as the harmony returns to C minor; the third weaves ascending and detached figures while modulating through G minor back to C minor; and the fourth cycles through C minor and E-flat major before settling again in C minor. The theme returns in the bass with its counter-melody split between upper voices, then appears once more in the treble over a sustained C pedal, now unaccompanied by its usual counter-melody, as the inner parts move freely. The piece concludes with a surprising brightening—a final C major chord replacing the expected minor.
