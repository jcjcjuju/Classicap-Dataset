A somber, introspective theme begins in a minor key, establishing a stable yet melancholic home base. Soon, the music shifts to a brighter, more open sound, then veers into a darker, tense mood, followed by a strikingly luminous and resonant tonality, and finally lands in a warm, expansive major key. The opening idea then returns, reshaped to guide the harmony back through its original poignant colors, ultimately resolving into the initial minor tonality with a sense of return and closure.
