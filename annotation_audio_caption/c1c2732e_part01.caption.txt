The movement opens with a clear, self-contained theme that feels complete and grounded, closing with a strong sense of resolution; this stability is then extended as the harmony lingers on the home pitch. A flowing passage of scale-like motion follows, with melodic patterns echoing one another in a loose, unfolding sequence. The music then shifts to a new, lyrical idea in a brighter key, which unfolds patiently through repeated phrases and cadences that gently stretch out its shape; within this section, short melodic fragments trade places between high and low voices in a subtle interplay. The closing bars briefly hint at a warmer, related key before settling into a sustained, quiet affirmation of the new tonal center.
