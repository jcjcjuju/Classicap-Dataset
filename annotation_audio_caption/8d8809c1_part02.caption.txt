The music revisits the bold, energetic character of the opening theme, now fragmented and transformed through shifting harmonic colors. It moves restlessly through distant tonal areas—first settling into the somber hues of A flat minor before brightening toward E flat major, then echoing this gesture in the darker shades of B flat and F minor. Voices trade roles in a contrapuntal dialogue, inverting the original melodic idea while continuing to drift through unstable harmonic terrain—touching on A flat major, B flat minor, and finally C minor. A striking, pungent chord—the Italian sixth in C minor—adds dramatic tension before the harmony pivots decisively, resolving into a poised dominant seventh that signals the imminent return to the home key.
