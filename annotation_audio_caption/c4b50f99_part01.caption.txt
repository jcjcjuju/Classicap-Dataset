A bold, angular theme in C minor is introduced in the alto, immediately answered in the treble with a version adjusted to sound in G minor, creating a sense of harmonic tension. A brief linking passage shifts the music back to C minor, followed by the same theme now in the tenor. Another transitional passage weaves through G minor and F minor before settling again in C minor. The bass then presents the adjusted version of the theme, now sounding in C minor itself, followed by the original theme in the treble and then the adjusted form in the alto. The music moves into a more unstable realm as the theme appears in the bass in F minor. It returns in the treble in its original form, soon overlapped by a slower, stretched-out version in the alto while the tenor echoes the adjusted theme freely. The harmony shifts restlessly—now the adjusted theme appears in the alto in G minor while the treble states the original theme also in G minor; then the tenor brings back the original theme in C minor as the treble offers the adjusted version in the distant key of A-flat major. A slower, weightier statement of the theme emerges in the bass, accompanied by an upside-down version in the treble. This inverted form continues in the bass, followed by a final straightforward statement of the theme in the bass. The texture tightens as the alto and treble overlap with the original and adjusted themes in close succession, then the treble states the theme in F minor, echoed by the tenor in the same key while the bass responds with an inverted, freely altered version. The movement concludes with a short closing passage that brings a sense of finality.
