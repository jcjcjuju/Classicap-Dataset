The music opens with a distinctive melodic figure that forms the basis of a balanced, two-part structure, the first part concluding with a strong, resolved cadence in E flat—a bright, stable point that feels like a temporary home. The second part begins immediately from this point, unfolding with a sense of purpose as the same essential theme reappears transposed, now leading through harmonic motion toward a final, fully settled cadence in A flat, the true tonal center. In the closing passage, fragments of the original theme echo in descending layers, intertwining freely and reinforcing the home key with quiet insistence.
