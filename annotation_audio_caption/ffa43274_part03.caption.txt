A lyrical theme, originally soft and flowing, now unfolds in a warmer, brighter key, supported by a stable harmonic foundation. This is followed by a sudden surge of energy—forceful accents and dynamic contrasts create tension as the music drives forward. The passage then settles into a graceful melody adorned with dotted rhythms and ornamental flourishes, shared between contrasting voices—one gentle, the other more assertive—ultimately resolving into a clear, stable tonal center that feels like a return home.
