A bold, rhythmic theme in G major opens the movement, its first half marked by a steady, unchanging pulse before unfolding into a lyrical connecting passage that climbs gently in the bass, culminating in a sustained A beneath a flowing, sequential melody. This leads to a contrasting second theme in D major: a graceful pair of phrases, the first closing with a sense of tension, the second resolving warmly before a short, recurring motif is heard three times—its final statement shifting toward A major. That same motif returns, guiding the music through a brief detour to G major before reestablishing D major. The section closes with fresh, songlike material that feels like an added thematic idea, distinct from what came before.
