A bold, energetic theme returns, now adorned with intricate embellishments that give it a more elaborate and expressive character, firmly rooted in the home key. This is followed by a passage that echoes the earlier transitional material, similarly enriched with decorative flourishes. The music then moves into a lyrical, contrasting theme, now also varied and settled securely in the tonic key, unfolding in two balanced spans that conclude with gentle cadential echoes. A brief, final gesture brings the movement to a quiet close.
