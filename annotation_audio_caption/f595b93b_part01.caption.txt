A gentle, softly articulated melody unfolds in F major, beginning with a quiet repetition of the dominant note before rising stepwise through repeated notes, small intervals, and spanning an octave from the lower to the upper tonic. A steady bass pedal on the tonic underpins the second and third bars, lending stability. The following phrase continues this tender character, frequently returning to a gently rocking second-inversion tonic chord before resolving with a clear and reassuring cadence that lands firmly on the tonic note. This entire opening idea returns with subtle changes: the start is slightly syncopated, the repeated dominant note is less prominent, and the texture is marginally richer. An episode then emerges with a similar rhythmic lilt, shifting harmonically through A minor before arriving at C major. From there, the music transposes the earlier closing gesture upward, then seamlessly guides the harmony back to F major, leading into a renewed statement of the initial theme. This return initially mirrors the earlier phrasing but is abruptly diverted—just as a strong resolution to F major seems imminent, the music veers into A minor, carrying the thematic material upward by a third and concluding with a somber cadence in that darker key. The section closes with a winding passage where hushed Siciliana rhythms intertwine with tense diminished seventh chords; these give way to repeated cadential motions that seem to affirm F major, yet the upper voice persistently emphasizes the note A, which lingers in the final moments, quietly challenging the stability of the home key.
