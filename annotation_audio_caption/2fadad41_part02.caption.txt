A bright, lyrical theme in F major unfolds, soon shifting toward C major, with melodies exchanged between high and low registers through frequent inversions of the musical lines. This material gives way to a developmental section that reshapes fragments of the theme, again flipping the melodic and bass roles in a clear mirror-like fashion. The opening theme then returns in a more compact form, now firmly grounded in F major from start to finish, resolving with a sense of arrival and stability absent in its earlier, more open-ended statement.
