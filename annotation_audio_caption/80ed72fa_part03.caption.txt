A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, underpinned by a sustained bass note that shifts from the dominant to D flat and back to the dominant, creating a sense of grounded tension. This leads into a transitional passage that echoes earlier material but unfolds more expansively before pivoting to a brighter, major-mode arrival. A lyrical second theme follows in this warm, stable major key, later shifting to a more introspective mood as it moves into the minor mode of the tonic. The movement concludes with an extended final section that weaves in echoes of the second theme—first in a distant, somber key, then returning to the dark hue of the original minor—before settling into a prolonged, resonant close in the home key.
