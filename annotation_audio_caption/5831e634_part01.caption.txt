A bold subject enters in the highest voice, establishing a bright D major tonality. It is soon answered in the middle voice in A major, accompanied by a flowing counter-melody above. A brief closing gesture follows, built from that same counter-melody. The subject then returns in the lowest voice, back in D major, with the counter-melody again in the top voice, now joined midway by its second half in the middle voice. The music continues with the subject reappearing irregularly in the top voice over a low counterpoint, still in D. A transitional passage unfolds through a descending sequence that shifts the harmony toward A major. Fragments of the subject emerge in the bass with a chromatic alteration, answered in inversion by the alto. The full subject resurfaces in the treble over a partial counter-subject in the bass, now in A, initiating a dense, overlapping entry that remains unresolved. This is followed by an inverted answer in the alto and a rising sequential line in the bass. A fragment of the counter-melody appears in the treble, then the subject enters successively in the bass and alto in close imitation, driving toward a cadence in A. The subject returns in the bass with its counter-melody above, immediately answered in inversion by the treble in another incomplete overlap. The subject then appears upside-down in the bass, shifting to D, with the counter-melody once more in the treble. A new episode modulates through darker harmonies from D minor to G minor, during which the inverted subject sounds in the bass, then is answered in inversion by the treble in a tightly woven, complete overlapping passage. The subject enters plainly in the alto, then is answered in inversion by the bass as the harmony moves toward G minor. Another transitional passage weaves through G minor back toward D minor via an F major inflection. An incomplete subject appears in the alto, followed by a full statement in the bass with another close but unresolved overlap. A final episode leads back to D minor. The subject then sounds firmly in the bass in D major, immediately echoed in the alto in another incomplete overlap. The music settles into a closing section over a sustained D in the bass, culminating in a bright, major final chord.
