A new theme emerges, beginning with a passage that subtly reshapes the bold, energetic character of the opening theme, now unfolding in G major and shifting into D minor. After this developmental gesture, the music introduces a distinct, independent idea that carries its own melodic identity. This leads into a sustained passage built over a repeating dominant note, creating a growing sense of anticipation that steadily drives toward the return of the main theme.
