A bold, stable theme in E flat major establishes a grounded, home-like character. This is followed by a contrasting transitional passage that introduces new musical ideas, starting from the same stable tonality but gradually shifting toward a brighter, more expectant key. A second theme then emerges in this new key, offering a lyrical contrast to the opening material. The section closes with a brief concluding passage that wraps up the exposition with a sense of finality.
