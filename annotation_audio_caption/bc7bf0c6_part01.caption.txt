A bold, balanced theme in G major opens the movement, presenting a four-bar idea that is immediately repeated a step higher, creating a sense of lift and continuity. This leads into a transitional passage that echoes part of the opening theme while briefly shifting toward a brighter, more expectant tonal area before settling into a sustained, resonant bass note that builds gentle tension. A contrasting lyrical theme then emerges in D major, unfolding in two parts: the first portion ends with a subtle shift to A major and is heard again, this time adjusted to firmly establish D major; the second portion remains rooted in this brighter key, flowing smoothly to a close. The section ends with a brief closing idea that recalls the transitional material, wrapping up the exposition with a sense of poised finality before the music begins anew.
