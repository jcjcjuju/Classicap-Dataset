A lyrical theme in A major unfolds with a bright, resonant quality, soon shifting toward the darker hues of F sharp minor and closing with a gentle, unresolved pause followed by delicate arpeggios. This theme returns, again starting in A major but now veering into C sharp minor, where it ends with another tentative cadence and soft arpeggiated chords. A new expressive melody emerges in C sharp minor, flowing into a sequential passage in F sharp minor before circling back to C sharp minor, only to conclude unexpectedly in the warm, open sound of E major. A light, nimble theme then takes hold in E major, briefly colored by tense, dissonant harmonies that add subtle unease. After a varied restatement of this entire sequence, the music enters a developmental section: the light theme from E major is carried through a series of fleeting tonal centers—A minor, F sharp major, then G major—never settling long in any one key. The expressive melody returns, now cast in successively darker keys: G minor, C minor, and finally A flat minor. This gives way to a transformed version of an earlier theme, first heard in E major and then propelled upward through a chain of minor keys—F sharp, G sharp, and ultimately B flat minor. The expressive melody resurfaces once more, now intense and fiery in B flat minor, its line subtly reshaped and repeatedly drawn back to a dominant harmony that creates mounting anticipation, while its closing gestures echo the rhythmic and melodic shape of the movement’s opening theme, smoothing the path for its imminent return.
