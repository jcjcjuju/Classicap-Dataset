A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, sounding stable and complete. It leads into a transitional passage that unfolds more expansively than before, still built from the opening motif but now reshaped to remain within the tonic key. A lyrical second theme follows, now also anchored in the home key, its first part gently balanced and closing with quiet assurance. Its middle section dramatically expands, weaving through shadowy, shifting harmonies—C minor, B-flat major, then G minor—with a descending sequence that heightens tension, culminating in rich, expressive chords that pull the ear through distant tonal colors. The final portion of this theme restores calm with a graceful, slightly extended phrase ending in a clear, settled cadence. The movement concludes with a brief, familiar closing figure, now comfortably resolved in the tonic.
