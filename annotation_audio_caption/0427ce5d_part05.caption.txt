A bold and triumphant statement of the opening theme returns, firmly rooted in A flat major, with harmonies that alternate between the stable home chord and a richer, more tense dominant seventh. This is followed by a striking shift: a series of dissonant diminished seventh chords create a sense of instability before unexpectedly resolving into the bright, distant key of E major, which feels both surprising and vivid. From there, the music unfolds a prolonged cadential motion, gradually winding down toward closure. The final section settles peacefully back into A flat major, weaving in the flowing character of the earlier episode theme over a foundation of the tonic chord, and culminates in a clear, satisfying resolution that firmly reaffirms the home key.
