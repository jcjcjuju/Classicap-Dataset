The music opens with a bold, self-contained theme in the home key, unfolding over an extended ten-bar span; its second phrase grows longer through echoing imitative fragments, creating a sense of expansion before arriving at a point of harmonic arrival that feels open and expectant. A brief transitional passage follows, built from repeating patterns that shift through darker harmonic colors, briefly touching G minor before settling on a suspended, unresolved cadence in F major. This leads into a contrasting section where the opening idea reappears in the lower register, now paired with a fresh, lyrical line above. The harmony stabilizes in F major, though colored by a gentle inversion at its close. A new theme then emerges over a sustained bass tone, unfolding with graceful symmetry; its phrases are extended by repeated cadential gestures that momentarily wander into the shadowy hues of F minor and the distant, warm glow of A flat major, highlighted by a striking, plaintive chord that adds expressive weight before the section concludes.
