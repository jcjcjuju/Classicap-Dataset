A bold, stable theme unfolds over a sustained G in the bass, establishing a grounded, home-like quality. This gives way to a transitional passage that shifts harmonically toward a brighter, more expectant area, featuring flowing arpeggios before veering into a warmer, lyrical key. A new melody then emerges—graceful and songlike—first presented plainly and then restated with subtle variation; midway, its lower voice rises to the upper register, creating a moment of delicate contrast. The section concludes with a strong, resolved cadence that reaffirms the original tonal center. A brief linking passage follows, setting up a return or continuation.
