A bold, energetic theme in F major unfolds with a chromatic bass line that moves downward, creating a sense of forward motion, and concludes with a shift to the brighter, more tense sound of C major. This theme is then heard again in full. A brief closing passage follows, echoing the final gesture of the theme first higher in pitch and then firmly back in the home key of F major. The music then enters a developmental section where fragments of the opening theme are passed between voices in imitation, soon joined by a new, distinct idea that is also imitated in the lower register; the remainder of this section weaves in further reminders of the original theme. The latter portion of the opening theme returns, now varied and sustained over a persistent C in the bass, reinforcing harmonic tension. A final extended coda begins with lively imitative counterpoint based on an earlier motif, features interweaving lines moving in opposite directions, and culminates with the closing phrase of the main theme now securely resolved in the stable, grounded sound of F major.
