The music begins immediately with a bold, angular theme in a somber minor key, soon giving way to a brighter, more stable major tonality that feels like a temporary resolution. This warmth is short-lived, as the harmony shifts toward a darker, tense minor key that creates a strong sense of anticipation. After the double bar, two distinct themes intertwine—one familiar from the opening, the other more lyrical—layered in close imitation. The music briefly revisits the earlier major tonality before moving through a shadowy, unsettled minor passage, then embarks on a stepwise descent that gradually pulls the harmony back toward the original somber key, restoring a sense of home but colored by the journey’s accumulated tension.
