A bold, energetic theme returns clearly in the home key, unchanged from its initial appearance. It is followed by a condensed and altered transitional passage that moves more quickly toward the next idea. A lyrical second theme then unfolds, now beginning in a darker, related minor key before shifting to the stable home major. This theme is significantly expanded: its opening phrase starts with rhythmic accents shifted to weaker beats, but through a subtle insertion of extra time, it realigns to its original accent pattern by the end; the immediate repetition of the phrase flips this effect, beginning with the original accents and ending with them displaced. This rhythmic play continues into the next phrase, which also carries the reversed emphasis. Within the extended structure, a newly added segment recalls material from the earlier transition, with its final portion sounding exactly as before. The section concludes with a slightly prolonged cadential passage that firmly reaffirms the home key with a strong, conclusive ending.
