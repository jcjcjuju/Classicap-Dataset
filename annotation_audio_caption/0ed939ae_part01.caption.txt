The music opens with a somber, unstable passage in B flat minor, quickly shifting through distant harmonic territories: a cadenza-like flourish in A flat minor gives way—via an enharmonic twist—to a striking, unexpected cadenza in the bright, contrasting key of E major. This moment of luminous tension soon dissolves into a return to A flat minor, establishing it as the central tonal area. A repeated chord firmly anchors this key, ushering in a flowing, continuous melody. This melody unfolds in four balanced phrases: the first begins with a grounded, melancholic character and moves toward a point of gentle suspense; the second starts similarly but gradually brightens, arriving at a warmer, more open sound; the third continues from this brighter mood but gradually steers back toward tension, halting just short of resolution; the fourth phrase returns fully to the initial somber tone, closing with a sense of quiet finality, followed by a brief, conclusive tail.
