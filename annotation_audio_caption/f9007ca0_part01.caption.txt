A bold, harmonically grounded theme unfolds with a descending bass line adorned by subtle ornaments, supported by solid chords occasionally enlivened by passing tones. This is followed by a contrasting idea featuring distinct melodic curves in its upper and lower parts, then a brief, striking motif, and shortly after, a new four-note figure that quickly gives way to a similar but altered shape. The music moves through a series of clear harmonic destinations—first settling with resolution into a bright, stable key a fifth above the home tonality, then shifting to a darker, minor realm related to the original key, next arriving at a warmly contrasting major key built on the fourth scale degree, and finally returning with conclusive certainty to the central, anchoring tonality.
