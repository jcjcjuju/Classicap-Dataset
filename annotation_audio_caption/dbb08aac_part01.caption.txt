A bold, energetic theme in F major is introduced in the upper voice, followed by a closely related answering phrase in the middle voice that shifts the music toward C major, creating a sense of departure without a supporting counter-melody. A winding transitional passage then unfolds, moving through a series of fleeting harmonic colors—G minor, B flat major, D minor—before settling back into F major, where the main theme reappears in the lowest voice. Another brief transition carries the harmony from F toward C, leading to a restatement of the answering phrase in the bass. The music then enters a lengthy, exploratory section built from fragments of earlier material, weaving through distant keys before returning to F and presenting the main theme again in the middle voice. A second episode follows, reshaping earlier motives with inverted contours and culminating in a sustained harmonic anchor as the music shifts toward B flat major, where the theme sounds once more in the bass. A final extended episode gradually guides the harmony back to F, setting up two conclusive statements of the main theme—first in the upper voice, then in the bass—with subtle embellishments: the upper version briefly introduces a chromatic twist, while the bass version climbs stepwise through four rising repetitions of the theme’s opening gesture. The movement closes with a short, stable coda in F major, affirming the home key with quiet finality.
