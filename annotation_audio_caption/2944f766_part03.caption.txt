A lyrical theme originally heard in the dominant key now returns in the home key, unfolding in two distinct sections. The first section shifts unexpectedly into the minor mode, creating a moment of shadowed tension that resolves not with closure but with an open, questioning pause, heightened by a striking dissonant chord. A brief connecting passage in the bass bridges the gap before the second section resumes, continuing the thematic material. This is immediately followed by a bold, compact theme—first introduced at the movement’s outset—overlapping seamlessly with what came before. The music then draws to a close with a short coda that echoes the final gesture of the opening section, now firmly anchored in the home key, bringing a sense of resolved finality.
