A bold, balanced theme in C major opens the movement, built from two equally long phrases that share the same rhythmic drive, creating a cohesive and stable musical statement. This is followed by a contrasting episode grounded by a sustained dominant tone, which then echoes the opening phrase with variation and elaborates on material from its middle portion. A new lyrical theme enters in G major, unfolding with grace before shifting into the darker hue of G minor; this section gradually builds tension over a prolonged dominant pedal, leading to a brief transitional passage that smoothly guides the music back to the original key. The initial bold theme returns, firmly reestablishing the home tonality with its clear rhythmic profile and structural symmetry.
