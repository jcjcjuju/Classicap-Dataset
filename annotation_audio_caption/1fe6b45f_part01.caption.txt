A bold, angular subject emerges in the bass, establishing a somber home base in A minor. It is answered in the alto with a subtly adjusted version that shifts the tonal center toward E minor, accompanied by a winding counter-melody in the bass. A brief codetta follows, its light, detached flourishes easing the music into C major. The subject then reappears in the treble, now back in A minor, paired with a responsive counter-subject in the alto. A short episode unfolds, built from fragments of the subject’s closing notes and the codetta’s quick, staccato figures, guiding the harmony to C major, where the subject returns in the bass with the counter-subject now in the treble. Another episode, drawing on the subject’s tail and counter-subject motifs, leads to E minor, where a tonal answer sounds in the treble with its counterpoint in the alto. A third episode weaves together echoes of the codetta’s flickering rhythm and the subject’s final gestures, steering back to A minor for the subject in the alto, supported by the counter-subject in the bass. The music then drifts toward D minor through a fourth episode that introduces a new imitative idea over a bass derived from the counter-subject, setting up the subject’s clear statement in the treble with bass counterpoint. A final episode, rich with the subject’s closing phrase and the counter-subject’s quick figures, pivots the harmony back to A minor. The subject resounds once more in the bass, now unaccompanied by its usual counterpoint, before a brief coda—hinting at fragments of both subject and counter-subject—brings the movement to a quiet close.
