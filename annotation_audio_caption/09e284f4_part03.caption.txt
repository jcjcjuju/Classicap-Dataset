The music begins with a bold, energetic theme in B flat minor, characterized by abrupt harmonic shifts and a striking chord that adds tension. This theme unfolds with a sudden turn to D flat major before snapping back to the minor mode, ending with an unresolved, suspenseful gesture. A trill in the bass adds subtle ornamentation midway through. Later, the harmonic drive intensifies with a prolonged buildup: a low, sustained dominant note anchors a series of dissonant diminished seventh chords and a biting dominant minor ninth, culminating in a strong, conclusive cadence. The coda opens unexpectedly in A major with a lyrical, modified version of a contrasting theme, colored by fleeting chromatic notes near the dominant. The rhythm of this theme persists as the music shifts into B flat minor, then glides through chromatic motion toward the warmth of D flat major. There, the opening bold theme returns, now in this brighter key, infused with heightened urgency and chromatic density as it races toward another firm cadence. The final section brings back the lyrical theme once more in D flat major, again tinged with chromatic inflections, briefly hinting at F major before closing with a clear, resolved cadence.
