A quiet, solemn three-note motif—“Le-be-wohl”—opens the piece, establishing a foundational idea that carries emotional weight and structural importance. This simple, distinctive gesture is immediately developed through a short sequence, then heard again in a slightly varied and transposed form, creating a sense of gentle echo or reflection. The overall mood is introspective, with the recurring motif shaping the harmonic and melodic landscape in a way that feels both deliberate and expressive.
