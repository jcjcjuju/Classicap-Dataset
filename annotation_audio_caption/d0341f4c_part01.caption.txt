A somber, intricate theme unfolds in the tenor, establishing a dark tonal center. Soon, a closely related answering phrase enters in the alto, accompanied by a distinctive, winding counter-melody in the tenor, shifting the mood toward a brighter but still tense harmonic area. A brief closing gesture follows, then the main theme returns deep in the bass, now paired with the counter-melody in the alto, reaffirming the original tonality. After another extended closing passage, the theme appears again in the highest voice, supported by the counter-subject in the bass, though with subtle harmonic irregularities. The music then moves through a series of transitional passages that shift between related keys, including a striking inverted version of the answer in the alto without its usual companion line, momentarily brightening the harmony. Further modulation leads to a clear statement of the answer in the treble with its counter-subject, settling into a new minor key, followed by another short closing figure. The original theme reappears in the tenor with the counter-subject above it, then returns again in the bass, this time flipped upside down and without the counter-melody. A final transitional passage weaves through distant harmonies before circling back. The piece concludes with the main theme in the treble, joined by its characteristic counter-subject in the alto, resolving peacefully with a surprising major chord at the very end.
