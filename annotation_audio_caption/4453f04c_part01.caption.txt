A bold, balanced theme in G major unfolds in two clear halves: the first half moves from a stable home base to a point of gentle tension, and the second half begins with that tension before resolving firmly back to stability; this entire theme is then heard again exactly as before. A contrasting passage follows, shifting to a darker, more introspective mood in E minor with a self-contained melodic idea, after which fragments of the original bold theme return, guiding the music back to the bright, stable home key. The main theme then reappears once more, its melody intact but now clothed in a fresh, varied accompaniment, and this time it is played through only once without repetition.
