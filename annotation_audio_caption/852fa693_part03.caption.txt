A bold, energetic theme returns, now slightly reshaped and firmly rooted in E flat major, though it concludes a little sooner than before. This leads into a transitional passage that unfolds with new harmonic direction, guiding the music smoothly back to the home key. A lyrical, contrasting theme then unfolds, now also settled securely in E flat major, lending it a warmer, more resolved character than its earlier appearance. The movement closes with a final, conclusive passage that reinforces the stability and completeness of the tonic key.
