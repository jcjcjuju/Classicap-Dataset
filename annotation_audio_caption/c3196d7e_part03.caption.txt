The music begins with a clear, stable statement of the opening theme in the home key, presenting its initial eight bars with a grounded, familiar character. This leads into an extended transitional passage that starts with the same opening motive now heard in the lower register instead of the upper, initiating a wandering, harmonically restless journey through a series of distant keys—F major, D-flat major, B-flat minor, and others—creating a sense of searching and instability. A short rhythmic figure from the original theme is passed between bass and treble, evolving and shifting until it settles into a darker, minor-mode version of the original transition, ending with a suspended, unresolved feeling. The second subject then returns firmly in the home key, its lyrical quality now enriched and expanded; after a concise closing phrase, a striking moment occurs where the opening theme and a contrasting idea from the second subject are woven together simultaneously, the latter acting as a counter-melody that intertwines with the former in a sophisticated blend of familiar materials. The section closes with a codetta that echoes the earlier triplet-based material, now securely anchored in the tonic key, providing a sense of arrival and cohesion.
