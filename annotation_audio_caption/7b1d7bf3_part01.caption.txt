The music begins with a bold, energetic theme that soon gives way to a passage grounded by a sustained bass note—the supertonic—creating a sense of anticipation as harmonies swirl above it. This tension resolves into a dominant pedal, a steady bass tone that reinforces a feeling of expectation before landing firmly on a conclusive cadence in the key of B minor, giving a strong sense of arrival in a darker, related tonal area. After a clear division, a new lyrical theme emerges in the upper voice while the lower voice echoes the opening idea upside-down, weaving a contrapuntal texture. Later, the harmony circles around a dominant pedal once more, building suspense before settling onto the home key’s tonic with a grounding, stable pedal that confirms the central tonality. The movement closes with a strong, satisfying cadence in E minor, though not without a striking, unexpected harmonic twist just before the end—a sudden, dramatic shift that momentarily surprises the ear before resolving into finality.
