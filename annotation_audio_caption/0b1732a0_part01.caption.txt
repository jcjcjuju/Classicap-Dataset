Over a sustained bass note that anchors the opening in a stable home key, a clear melody unfolds in steady quarter notes, accompanied by flowing sixteenth-note arpeggios and ornamental passagework. The harmony briefly shifts to a darker, more somber color before brightening into a warmer, closely related major area. This first section concludes with a strong, resolving cadence that firmly establishes the dominant key as a new point of arrival. The music then settles onto a repeating dominant bass tone, over which the opening melodic idea returns, now transformed by its new harmonic context. This leads to a deceptive turn that avoids expected resolution, continuing with the same thematic material above the persistent dominant pedal, until the harmony finally settles back into the home key, now clearly and brightly affirmed with a major third.
