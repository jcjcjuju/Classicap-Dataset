A bold, angular theme in B flat minor is introduced in the highest voice, soon answered by a tonally adjusted version in F minor in the next lower voice. A brief connecting passage follows, leading to the theme’s return in the alto, again in B flat minor, answered by the tenor in F minor, and then stated once more in the bass. The music then shifts through a series of modulations, beginning with a passage that moves from B flat minor toward D flat major, where the subject reappears in that brighter key, followed by an answer in E flat minor. The theme continues to weave through different voices and keys—tenor in B flat minor, bass in E flat minor—interspersed with short codettas and another modulating episode that cycles through A flat, E flat, and back toward B flat. Intensifying contrapuntal activity emerges as multiple voices overlap in close succession, presenting both the subject and its answer in E flat minor in rapid, layered succession across all parts. This dense texture gradually unwinds into a final modulating episode that settles back into B flat minor. The closing section features the subject and answer tightly interwoven again in the home key, now with all five voices entering in quick succession. The movement concludes with a quiet reminiscence of earlier melodic fragments, ending unexpectedly but gently in B flat major.
