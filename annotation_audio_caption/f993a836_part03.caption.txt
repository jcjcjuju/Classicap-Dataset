A bold, energetic theme returns, now reshaped in its melodic contour but still grounded in the same stable home key, creating a familiar yet fresh impression. This is followed by a contrasting passage that unfolds with new surface details but remains anchored in the same harmonic framework—an unusual choice that sustains a sense of continuity rather than departure. The bold theme then reappears once more, again varied in its outer shape but harmonically unchanged, reinforcing its central role. The movement concludes with a coda that vividly recalls the main theme, weaving its essence into a final, resonant closing statement.
