A bold, energetic theme in B flat major opens the music, built from a concise two-bar idea that shapes nearly everything that follows. This theme unfolds over eight bars, culminating in a clear sense of tension as it lands on the dominant, then immediately returns an octave higher with subtle changes to its shape. What follows is a developmental passage that explores and transforms the opening idea, creating a sense of motion and variation; this entire developmental span then returns once more with slight alterations, enriching the texture while maintaining the foundational character of the original theme.
