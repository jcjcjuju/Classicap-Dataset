A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, now stretched and reshaped with subtle variation. It gives way to a transitional passage built on familiar rhythmic ideas, whose final moments shift direction to land on a bright G major instead of the expected D. A lyrical second theme follows, now grounded in the comforting stability of the home key, its opening phrase extended and its continuation gently altered while staying in the same harmonic area. A brief, anticipatory passage then leads into a final, condensed return of the opening theme, which now serves as a closing epilogue. This coda features sustained bass notes above which harmonies unfold, culminating in a striking, suspenseful pause on a tense dominant seventh chord—its fifth sharpened to create added friction—before resolving unexpectedly into a warm A major chord.
