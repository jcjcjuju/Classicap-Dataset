A bold, energetic theme opens the music, immediately followed by a contrasting idea; this pair of ideas forms the foundational material. Soon, the upper voices invert their earlier roles while the bass remains steady, and a new detached, rhythmic figure emerges, cascading downward in sequence. A second theme then appears in the upper line—graceful and subdivided into two distinct gestures—while the bass echoes a fragment of the first theme, and both lines descend together in sequential motion. The music passes through moments of arrival: first a strong cadence in the dominant minor, then another in the supertonic major, before building toward a final, resolute cadence in the bright key of D sharp major. The entire section then returns with the opening theme now transposed into that dominant key, unfolding with renewed energy and leading through further sequential development. Later, the second theme reappears transposed higher, now intertwined with the first theme’s material in a denser, contrapuntal texture. The music eventually circles back to the original opening theme—slightly varied—and concludes with a firm, satisfying cadence in the home key of G sharp minor.
