A bold, energetic theme—originally heard in F major—now appears in the brighter key of D major, creating a striking shift in color. This is followed by a transitional passage that weaves fragments of the opening theme through shifting harmonies, eventually settling back into the home key of F major for the return of the theme’s second and third sections, restoring a sense of familiarity. The music then moves into a lyrical second subject, now firmly grounded in F major, featuring a flowing, sequential elaboration of its opening phrase that was absent earlier. The movement concludes with a closing section whose final cadence is emphatically restated, reinforcing the tonal stability of the home key.
