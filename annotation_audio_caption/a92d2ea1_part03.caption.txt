The music returns to the opening material: a bold, energetic theme in F major unfolds with a sense of stability, then shifts toward a brighter, more expectant quality as it moves to C major. This is followed by a brief closing passage that echoes earlier melodic shapes, first higher in pitch and then settling back into the home key of F major. A developmental section ensues, weaving imitative fragments from the opening theme into a restless, searching texture, introducing a new rhythmic idea that is passed between voices. The opening theme reappears, now varied and grounded by a sustained dominant tone, leading into a final flourish—a vigorous, imitative passage that builds momentum through opposing melodic lines before resolving with a clear, satisfying return of the theme’s closing gesture, now firmly anchored in F major.
