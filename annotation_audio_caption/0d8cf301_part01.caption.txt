A bold, angular subject emerges in the tenor voice, establishing a stable home base in A flat major, soon answered by a lower bass voice that shifts the harmony toward E flat major, accompanied by a flowing counter-melody in the tenor. A brief closing gesture follows, leading to the subject’s reappearance in the treble, now paired with a fragment of the counter-melody in the bass. The answer returns in the alto without its usual companion melody, and the music transitions into a wandering episode that shifts harmonically back toward A flat. The subject reappears in the tenor, now with a subtly altered counterpoint in the bass. This gives way to another episode built on imitative fragments and suspensions, steering the harmony into the darker realm of F minor, where the subject enters in the alto with a varied counter-melody. A third episode continues this unsettled character, modulating further to B flat minor, where the subject sounds again in the tenor—this time alone—followed by its answer in the alto. Another episode guides the music back toward A flat, introducing fragmented echoes of the subject and answer in close succession. A full answer returns in the alto with a slight alteration, supported by the familiar counter-melody in the tenor, while simultaneously the subject appears in the treble over a different harmonic backdrop. In the alto, a transformed version of the subject unfolds as a chain of suspended ninth chords. A final episode weaves suspensions in the upper voices above a running line derived from the counter-melody, climbing through distant harmonies before settling back into A flat. The subject then resounds in the deep bass, followed by answers that flicker through C minor and D flat major, each accompanied by evolving counter-lines. The movement concludes with a coda in A flat major, where the subject returns clearly in the treble, and a final, fleeting echo of the counter-melody lingers in the alto.
