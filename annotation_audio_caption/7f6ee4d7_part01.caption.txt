A bold, somber theme unfolds in G minor, establishing a stable home base; its first four-bar phrase lifts into a brighter, more open sound—the relative major—before the next four bars return with resolution to the darker, grounded character of G minor. This sense of departure and return is immediately followed by a shift in harmonic color, as the music pivots smoothly toward the warm, expansive realm of E flat major.
