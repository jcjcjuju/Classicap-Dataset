A lyrical eight-bar phrase in D flat major unfolds with a sense of calm resolution, soon returning with subtle changes and shifting to G flat major, where its character is preserved but colored by the new tonal center. This idea appears again in G flat major, then repeats with minor alterations before drifting into the darker hue of E flat minor. A brief three-bar passage creates gentle harmonic motion that guides the music back to the stability of D flat major, where the original phrase returns, now sounding an octave lower with a richer, deeper resonance. The section closes with a short transition that subtly prepares a return to earlier material.
