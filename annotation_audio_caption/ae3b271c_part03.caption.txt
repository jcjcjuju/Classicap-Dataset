A bold, energetic theme in E flat major returns, followed by a striking inversion of part of that same theme. A transitional passage then begins by closely echoing the opening bars of the movement before shifting harmonically to build tension toward a dominant chord. The music then presents a lyrical second theme, now settled securely in the home key of E flat major. Another transitional section follows, starting in A flat major with material reminiscent of an earlier episode, and it builds anticipation by concluding on a dominant seventh chord. The movement draws to a close with a coda that recalls the introduction to the third movement, transposed into E flat; after a dramatic cadenza, the pace accelerates into a swift, exhilarating finale built from the second and third notes of the main theme.
