A bold, distinctive theme emerges in the alto voice, establishing a bright and stable tonal center. It is immediately answered in a higher voice with a transposed version of the same theme, now sounding brighter and more tense, while a complementary counter-melody weaves beneath it. The original theme then resurfaces in the lowest voice, its character grounded and resonant, as the counter-melody returns above it. This gives way to a restless, shifting passage that moves through several darker, related keys before circling back to the original tonality, during which three interwoven melodic ideas are continually recombined in different voices. The main theme then appears in the highest voice, now supported by its counter-melody in the bass, restoring a sense of clarity. Another transitional passage follows, built from fragments of the counter-melody, gradually steering the music toward a new key. There, the transposed version of the theme enters in the bass, accompanied by the familiar counter-melody above, before the original theme returns once more in the alto with its counterpart in the bass. The music then shifts into a more unsettled mood as the theme appears in a somber minor key in the treble, paired again with its counter-melody. A second extended transitional section unfolds, using the same interlocking material as the earlier one but exploring new harmonic territory, eventually arriving at a radiant new key where the theme sounds warmly in the alto with its counter-melody above. A final transitional passage, mirroring the earlier one in construction, guides the music back toward the original tonality. The theme then reappears in the bass, reaffirming the home key, followed by a brief, harmonically restless link that briefly brightens into a related key. In that brighter key, the transposed theme sounds alone in the alto, unaccompanied by its usual counterpart. Another short link quickly returns the music to the original tonality, where the main theme is heard once more in the treble, now with a subtly varied counter-melody in the alto. The piece concludes with a final, serene passage that settles firmly into the home key.
