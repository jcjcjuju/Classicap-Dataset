A bold, balanced theme in the home key unfolds with a strong sense of resolution, closing firmly with a conclusive cadence. This is followed by a transitional passage that shifts the tonal center upward, arriving at a bright new key where it pauses expectantly on an unresolved harmonic gesture. A contrasting lyrical idea then emerges in this new key, featuring a responsive phrase that seems to echo and overlap itself, creating a subtle rhythmic ambiguity that feels like a shift in accent but ultimately maintains a steady underlying pulse. The overlapping phrases share a common moment that serves both as an ending and a beginning, blurring the boundary between them. The section closes with a brief harmonic link that lingers on a tense, dominant sonority, creating anticipation for what follows.
