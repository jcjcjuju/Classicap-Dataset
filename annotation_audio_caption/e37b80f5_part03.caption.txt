The music begins with a bold, agitated theme in C sharp minor, characterized by chromatic descent and restless energy, which unfolds as before but soon shifts through a sequence toward the brighter, more ambiguous realm of E major and minor. A contrasting chorale-like theme follows in E major, its slower, hymn-like character now grounded in this new key, yet it soon moves toward its subdominant, preserving the earlier sense of lyrical expansion. This same chorale idea continues, now colored by the darker hue of E minor, then flows into F sharp minor, growing increasingly elaborate until it emerges in a radiant C sharp major, stretched into an extended form and underscored by a sustained dominant pedal that builds harmonic tension. Briefly, powerful double octaves recall the opening theme’s urgency in C sharp minor, leading into a final section where that same driving motive returns in a rushed, intensified stretto. The movement closes with a decisive cadence and a surprising shift to a major-key ending, offering a moment of unexpected brightness after the prevailing minor-mode intensity.
