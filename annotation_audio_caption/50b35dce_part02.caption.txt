The music unfolds with fragmented echoes of the lyrical second subject, reshaped and developed through shifting harmonic landscapes. It settles into a warm, expansive passage in E flat major, which soon gives way to a fleeting, darker turn through C minor before finding its way back to the home key of G minor. The section builds toward a moment of poised tension—a dominant seventh chord—where a C natural rises chromatically through C sharp to D, creating a subtle but striking sense of anticipation.
