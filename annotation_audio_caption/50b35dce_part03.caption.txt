A bold, eight-bar theme in G minor returns, establishing a stable home base with a strong sense of closure on the dominant. This is followed by a transitional passage that echoes the earlier connective material but now leads decisively toward the dominant key. A lyrical two-bar phrase then unfolds in the tonic G minor, heard three times with rising pitch levels, overlapping into a longer four-bar idea that is both varied and stretched out in its return. The movement concludes with a coda built from the second subject’s opening motif, now prolonged over a sustained bass note for its final eight bars, resolving peacefully with a bright major chord on the home pitch.
