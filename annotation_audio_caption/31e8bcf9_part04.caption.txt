A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, now paired with fresh accompanying figures; as it shifts to the lower register, the accompaniment transforms once more, omitting a previously heard repetition. This leads into a passage of flowing, ornamental lines over a sustained bass note, mirroring earlier material but steering the harmony toward the tonic rather than away from it. A lyrical, balanced theme then unfolds in the home key, its phrases echoing the structure of an earlier contrasting theme but now grounded in stability, slightly extended near its close. The movement concludes with a gentle, reflective coda that draws its character and shape from the opening energetic theme, now softened in tempo and mood.
