A bold, balanced theme opens in the home key, its initial gesture immediately echoed a step lower, creating a sense of stepwise motion. This idea unfolds again in a slightly altered form, now resolving with a clear, stable closure rather than leaving the harmony hanging. Fragments of this theme then drive a transitional passage that shifts the tonal center upward, arriving at a bright, closely related key where the music pauses expectantly. A new lyrical melody emerges in this brighter key, its phrases subtly compressed and extended through overlapping and inserted material, yet its closing gesture mirrors the earlier theme’s cadence, lending a sense of familiar resolution. After a brief, freely interpreted pause, the opening theme returns—this time only its first half—before a quick, rising three-note figure leads away into new territory.
