A stately theme unfolds in E flat major, establishing a clear and stable tonal center. This is followed by a contrasting section that shifts to the brighter, more assertive sound of B flat major, creating a sense of departure. A brief developmental passage then introduces subtle harmonic restlessness and motivic exploration, weaving through related keys with a sense of gentle instability. The opening thematic material returns, now unified entirely in the home key of E flat major, restoring a feeling of resolution and completeness.
