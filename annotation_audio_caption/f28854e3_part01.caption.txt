A steady, chordal texture unfolds with a dignified, sustained bass line, as a recurring arpeggiated figure gently shapes each harmony. The music begins with a clear, stable sense of C major, then gradually shifts toward a brighter, more expectant tonal center, arriving at a conclusive cadence that feels resolved yet lifted. From there, the harmony eases back toward the original tonal home, subtly winding down with increasing warmth and certainty until it lands firmly back in the reassuring stability of the opening key. The passage then extends into a reflective coda: a prolonged, resonant emphasis on the dominant note creates a hovering tension, which finally gives way to a grounded, peaceful close anchored in the tonic.
