The music begins with a distinctive figure introduced in the upper voice, immediately echoed in contrary motion by the bass, creating a sense of dialogue. This opening idea unfolds with a feeling of forward motion, eventually settling into a stable, resolved cadence in a bright, elevated key. A new, flowing theme then emerges in the upper register, accompanied by a rolling bass line, and this material is sequenced through a series of shifting tonal centers—some darker and more introspective, others brighter—before arriving at a strong, conclusive cadence that establishes a clear and grounded home key. Following this, another new theme appears, more restless in character, guiding the harmony through a rapid succession of distant, shadowy keys, each briefly touched upon before the music lingers on a sustained, expectant tone that creates a sense of anticipation. This tension is finally released as the opening figure returns, slightly altered, now firmly rooted in the home key, and leads to a decisive, satisfying close.
