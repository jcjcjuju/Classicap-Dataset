A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, establishing a sense of stability. It is immediately overlapped by a transitional passage that begins with the same opening gesture, now transformed: the earlier melody in E flat major is absent, replaced by a brief, unexpected turn into the distant key of D flat major. The music then moves into a lyrical second theme, now cast in the minor mode of the home key, giving it a more somber and introspective quality than before, and slightly extended in length. This leads directly into a closing section built from the opening theme’s material, where upper and lower parts trade roles in imitative dialogue, unfolding in a sequence that creates a gentle, winding descent toward the final cadence.
