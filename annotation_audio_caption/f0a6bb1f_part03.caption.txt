A lyrical melody, now grounded in the home key, unfolds with graceful character, followed by a passage that echoes the opening theme but reshaped into this stable tonal center. This is succeeded by a bold, energetic theme, richly decorated with ornamental flourishes, which returns with heightened expressiveness and extended cadential gestures that reinforce a sense of finality. The movement concludes with a brief coda that gently echoes the prevailing mood before settling into quiet closure.
