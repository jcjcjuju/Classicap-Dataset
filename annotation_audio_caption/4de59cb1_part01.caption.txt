A bold, balanced theme unfolds in short, self-contained phrases, each ending with a clear point of rest that lands lightly rather than emphatically. This main idea is followed by a contrasting passage in a brighter, related key, where a lyrical melody is extended through repeated cadential gestures that gently stretch out its conclusion. A brief harmonic transition then emerges, built on a rich, complex chord that subtly shifts color as certain notes slide downward, ultimately settling into a strong, expectant harmony that sets up the return of the opening theme—now adorned with graceful embellishments that sparkle around its original shape.
