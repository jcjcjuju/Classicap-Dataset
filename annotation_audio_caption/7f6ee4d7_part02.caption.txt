A lyrical theme unfolds in the warm, stable tonality of E flat major, maintaining its harmonic grounding without shifting to another key. This is followed by a transitional passage that gradually builds a sense of movement and anticipation, steering the music away from E flat major and guiding it back toward the darker, more grounded tonality of G minor.
