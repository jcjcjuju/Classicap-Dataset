A bold, stable melody in E-flat major unfolds in balanced four-bar phrases, creating a grounded and centered impression. This is followed by a brief, subtle departure that gently shifts the harmonic color without losing coherence, before the opening melody returns unchanged, reaffirming the home key with clarity and symmetry. The music then moves into a contrasting section in C minor, introducing a new, more somber melody that soon shifts toward G minor; this idea is immediately restated in full, deepening the expressive contrast. A transitional passage of sequential patterns builds momentum, leading back to a varied return of the C-minor melody, now firmly closing in that key with a strong sense of finality. After a brief modulatory link, only fragments of the original E-flat major theme reappear, offering a fleeting reminder of the opening before giving way to a new lyrical episode in A-flat major. This section presents a graceful melody that temporarily brightens through a shift to E-flat major, then returns to A-flat, all within a clear two-part structure. Another short link ushers back hints of the main theme in E-flat, again only partially stated. The movement concludes with a coda that weaves together motives drawn from the earlier contrasting episodes, creating a reflective synthesis of the journey’s secondary ideas rather than returning to the primary theme.
