A lyrical second theme unfolds in E flat major, beginning with a rich V9–I harmonic progression that initially leaves the tonal center ambiguous between E flat and B flat. The melody is adorned with expressive dissonances—suspensions and appoggiaturas—over a steady quarter-note broken-chord accompaniment. A syncopated rhythmic feel emerges, briefly suggesting a hemiola as the melody groups beats into threes rather than twos. The harmony then flows through a circle of fifths, creating a sense of graceful motion, before the theme returns with renewed clarity, now firmly establishing E flat major through a decisive sequence of chords leading to a strong cadence. This leads seamlessly into a continuation of the theme, where a sustained E flat in the bass anchors the harmony while the melody echoes the rising contour of the earlier first theme. In the final bars, the bass ascends by thirds, shifting the harmonic direction toward A minor and arriving on its dominant chord, poised for what follows.
