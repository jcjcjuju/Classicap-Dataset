A bold, lyrical theme in E major unfolds, beginning with a four-bar phrase that lands on a tense, expectant chord, followed by two shorter phrases—each a step lower than the last—creating a balanced, conclusive statement. This theme returns in a condensed form, preserving its essential character but more briefly stated. The music then shifts to a transitional passage built from a fragment of the opening theme, now glowing with the brighter color of the dominant key, B major. A new, gentler melody emerges in this key, smooth and songlike, and is immediately restated with subtle variation. The opening theme then reappears in its original key, restoring a sense of home. This is followed by another transitional passage that first echoes the main theme in a darker, minor mode before drifting into a new tonal area, G major, where a sustained bass note anchors a recurrence of the earlier transitional figure.
