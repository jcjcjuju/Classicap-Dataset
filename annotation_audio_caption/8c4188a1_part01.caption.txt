The music begins with a lyrical phrase that settles into a bright, stable resolution in a closely related major key, creating a gentle sense of arrival. This is followed by a second phrase that moves toward a more distant harmonic area, concluding with another clear and resolved cadence that feels subtly removed from the opening tonal center. A third section then unfolds, building tension through a sustained dominant note in the bass before easing into a final passage grounded by a steady tonic pedal, which firmly reestablishes the original key with a quiet sense of closure. Throughout, the texture is animated by ornamental flourishes—graceful shakes, quick arpeggios, and rapid thirty-second-note figures—that weave through the voices, sometimes inverted, adding intricate detail to the harmonic flow.
