A bold, energetic theme unfolds in the home key, marked by frequent repetitions and a striking exchange of melody and accompaniment between high and low registers. A sustained bass note underpins the opening phrase, after which the main tune shifts to the lower voice, flipping the texture upside down. This pattern of inversion continues throughout, with phrases echoing and reshaping themselves through tonal shifts and layered imitations. An unexpected harmonic pause creates suspense before the music circles back, now with voices inverted again, leading into a lively contrapuntal passage built from the theme’s opening gesture. This momentum carries directly into a transition that fragments the main motive into just four notes, spinning them into a winding line that lands on an unresolved, tense chord in a minor key. A contrasting second theme then emerges in a brighter major key, its lyrical phrase immediately answered a step higher with a new bass figure that becomes a recurring presence. The melody soon moves to the bass and is mirrored in the treble, while triplet rhythms spark playful exchanges in opposite directions between hands. This material is varied and passed back and forth, culminating in a deceptive cadence that pivots to a new key. There, a fresh idea appears in the bass alone, then stretches out over a sustained pedal tone as the upper voices echo and imitate it in intricate counterpoint—sometimes flipping its shape, sometimes following closely at a fixed interval. The music settles into a minor-key cadence before winding back toward the original major key through a series of evasive, extended closures that delay finality with chromatic harmonies and syncopated rhythms, ultimately resolving with quiet assurance. The section closes with a brief codetta featuring flowing triplet figures drawn from the second theme’s opening.
