The music opens with a fleeting echo of the bold, arpeggiated theme first heard at the beginning of the movement. Soon, a fragment of the lyrical second subject emerges, now cast in a darker, unsettled mood and shifted into a lower register where its melody resonates in the bass. This gives way to an extended passage built over a sustained, tense harmonic foundation that creates a sense of anticipation, as if circling around a resolution without yet arriving.
