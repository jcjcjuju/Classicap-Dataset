The music unfolds with material derived from a short, distinctive idea first heard early in the opening theme, now transformed and explored through shifting harmonic landscapes. From the outset, this fragment is developed extensively, creating a sense of restless motion and invention. Midway through, two independent melodic lines intertwine in a continuous contrapuntal exchange, each mirroring the other at a fixed interval, producing a tightly woven, intricate texture. Toward the end, a contrasting lyrical gesture—drawn from the latter portion of the secondary theme—emerges briefly, reimagined and colored by sudden shifts between bright major and somber minor harmonies. The entire section builds anticipation, culminating in a tense, unresolved chord that hangs in the air, demanding resolution.
