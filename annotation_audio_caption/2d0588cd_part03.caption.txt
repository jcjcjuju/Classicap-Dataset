A bold, lyrical theme in A major returns, unfolding with a clear four-bar phrase that closes securely, followed by a contrasting four-bar phrase that briefly brightens into E major before circling back to restate part of the original melody and leading into a fleeting three-note link. This is then followed by a closing passage that blends the fluid, modulating character of the earlier episode with quick, shimmering thirty-second-note flourishes that echo the main theme, culminating in a final cadence that gently reaffirms the home key.
