A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, now more concise, followed by a transitional passage that reworks the closing gesture of that theme before flowing into its original concluding material. A lyrical second theme then unfolds, first with a somber quality in the minor mode and then brightening into the major. The movement closes with a distinctive motif heard earlier, leading into a flourish of arpeggios, a dramatic cadenza, and a final nod to the opening theme.
