A bold, stable theme in C major is heard, establishing a clear sense of home. This theme returns immediately with the same melodic character but now leads to a brighter, more expectant conclusion in the dominant key. A contrasting episode follows, introducing a new three-bar idea that shifts into a darker, more unsettled mood in D minor; this idea is then restated a step lower, deepening the sense of departure before transitioning through harmonic tension toward the dominant key. A brief, improvisatory flourish then guides the music back to the reassuring stability of C major, where the original theme reappears, subtly altered in its surface details but still grounded in its familiar harmonic foundation.
