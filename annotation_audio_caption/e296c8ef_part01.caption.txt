A persistent four-note figure, marked by a distinctive dissonant passing tone, unfolds over a steady C minor foundation, anchored by a low tonic pedal that hums beneath the opening bars. Gradually, the music eases away from this somber home toward a brighter, more open sound, arriving at the relative major key with a sense of calm resolution. From there, the harmony begins a gentle return journey, guided by a dominant pedal that tightens the pull back toward C minor, culminating in a poised, expectant pause on the dominant chord. This tension then gives way to a final passage built on alternating harmonic anchors—first a sustained dominant tone that creates a hovering, unresolved quality, then a return to the grounding stability of the tonic pedal, bringing the music to a firm and centered close.
