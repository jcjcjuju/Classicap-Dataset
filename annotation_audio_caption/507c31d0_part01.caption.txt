Two distinct, tightly interwoven melodic figures dominate the soundscape: one introduced in the lower register, the other in the upper, immediately trading places in a continuous exchange that creates a dense web of imitation. The music begins with a grounded, minor-key character, then quickly shifts into a series of contrasting tonal colors—sometimes darker, sometimes brighter—as it passes through related keys, each shift marked by the same pair of themes reappearing in new harmonic surroundings. Midway through, the themes briefly occupy these new keys for only a single bar instead of two, tightening the fabric of the music. After exploring a warm major-key area and other neighboring tonalities, the harmony settles momentarily on a strong, unresolved stopping point that feels expectant rather than final. In the second half, the same thematic material returns but often flipped upside down, creating a sense of familiar yet transformed echoes. This inverted treatment prevails until near the very end, when the original forms of the themes reemerge to firmly reestablish the home key with a conclusive, stable resolution. Throughout, the texture remains animated by constant imitation, with the two themes almost always appearing together, locked in a seamless contrapuntal dialogue.
