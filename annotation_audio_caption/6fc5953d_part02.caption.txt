The music begins with a shadowy, inverted echo of the opening theme, now cast in a darker, unsettled mood. A distinctive five-note motif—first heard in the transition—dominates the unfolding texture, its second half stretched out in longer notes. This figure is passed between high and low voices, the bass climbing step by step through chromatic tones, steering the harmony through shifting, restless keys. The tension builds and transforms as the motif moves entirely into the upper register, spiraling through stark minor harmonies before arriving at a poised, expectant chord that signals arrival in a brighter key, yet still charged with anticipation.
