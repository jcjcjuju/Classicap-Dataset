The music begins with a descending sequence built from a two-bar idea that features a leap of a perfect fourth, now heard with subtly altered accompaniment. This pattern shifts through a series of tonal centers—bright D major, then the more somber B minor, briefly touching C major before settling into A minor, where the same sequence returns with the melodic and bass lines flipped. A tense, dramatic passage follows, built around a dissonant German sixth chord that resolves into a sustained focus on the dominant E, creating strong harmonic anticipation. The opening bold motive of the first subject then emerges, passed back and forth between high and low registers, as the harmony journeys through darker keys—E minor, then D minor—before finally arriving at the stable, home tonality of C major. The section closes with that same bold opening figure firmly rooted in the tonic key, immediately echoed an octave higher to launch the next section.
