The music begins with a stable, grounded feeling as a sustained bass note anchors the opening, leading to a clear and resolved close in the home key. It then moves through a series of shifting harmonic colors—briefly brightening into G major, then darkening through D minor and A minor—before settling firmly into D minor with a strong cadence. From there, the harmony continues to explore, touching G minor and returning to D minor before arriving at a brighter, conclusive moment in F major. The final section revisits earlier harmonic paths, weaving through G major, D minor, and G minor once more, gradually guiding the music back to the home key. A steady bass pedal reinforces the tonal center, culminating in a decisive and satisfying close that firmly reestablishes the original key. Throughout, a distinctive rhythmic-melodic figure—built from quick notes followed by a short arpeggio—appears in various voices, sometimes split between parts or mirrored in opposite motion, lending cohesion and contrapuntal energy to the unfolding harmonies.
