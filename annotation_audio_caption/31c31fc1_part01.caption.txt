A lyrical, song-like melody unfolds over a steady accompaniment, beginning in a somber E minor that soon brightens as it moves into the warmer tones of its relative major, C major. This shift brings a gentle contrast before the music briefly cycles through related keys—returning momentarily to E minor, then touching on C major again in a sequential passage, and later drifting into the plaintive sound of A minor. The opening mood gradually reasserts itself, guiding the music back to E minor for a clear and conclusive resolution. A short transitional passage follows, shifting the tonal center toward A minor with a sense of departure. Suddenly, the tempo quickens into a lively Presto, where rhythmic energy takes hold; the texture becomes more active and eventually fuller, building from two voices into rich four-part harmony. Within this faster section, the music briefly explores A minor and C major once more before firmly reestablishing the home key of E minor.
