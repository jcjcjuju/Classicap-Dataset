The music shifts to a new, contrasting episode that begins with a brief, introductory gesture echoing the opening theme’s character, though now in B flat major. A short, distinct phrase follows and is immediately heard again, first transformed into the darker hue of G minor and then reshaped into the warmer tonality of E flat major. From there, the music flows into a passage in E flat major that builds tension, culminating in a dominant seventh chord that strongly pulls toward F major. This leads into a series of modulating fragments that weave in rhythmic or melodic hints of the main theme, growing increasingly unstable until the entire section settles on a sustained dominant seventh chord, creating a palpable sense of anticipation.
