A bold, energetic theme in B flat major returns, built from a concise two-bar idea that unfolds through repetition and development, creating a sense of stability and forward motion. This material is fully restated with its original contours and harmonic grounding. The music then shifts direction as the tonal center dissolves through an enharmonic pivot—B flat becomes A sharp—ushering in a new, darker color in B minor. The movement concludes with a clear echo of the opening gesture, bringing the piece full circle with a final, resonant nod to its initial statement.
