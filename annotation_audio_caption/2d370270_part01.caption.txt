A bold, assertive theme in C minor opens the movement, built entirely from stable and tense harmonies that firmly establish the home key, its phrases gradually tightening from four-bar spans into more urgent two-bar units. This gives way to a lyrical, flowing passage that unfolds three times, each iteration colored by a new tonal center—first warm and rounded in A flat major, then darker in F minor, and finally more distant in D flat major—before settling into a sustained bass note that anchors a harmonically restless stretch, punctuated by a striking sequence of three distinct, pungent augmented sixth chords. A contrasting second theme emerges in the brighter key of E flat major, unfolding in clear four-bar segments and momentarily recalling the opening’s bold character before closing with a strong, conclusive cadence. The section ends with a brief coda that echoes the closing gestures of the earlier lyrical passage, wrapping up the exposition with a sense of poised finality.
