A bold, arpeggiated theme in C sharp minor returns with its original contours intact, establishing a firm sense of home. Without transition, the music moves directly into the second subject, now also grounded in the same somber tonic key, slightly tightened by the omission of a single measure. The closing section begins with a fleeting echo of the opening arpeggios, then shifts into a tense, harmonically unstable passage built on rapid diminished seventh chords. A fragment of the second subject reappears, now imbued with finality, leading into flowing arpeggios that briefly touch on a striking, plaintive harmony before settling onto a sustained low C sharp. Over this anchoring drone, the music recalls the closing gesture of the main theme, fading into quiet resolution.
