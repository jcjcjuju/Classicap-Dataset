A bold, dramatic theme in B minor returns, marked by a steady bass pedal and rich harmonic tension from frequent diminished seventh chords and chromatic inflections. This gives way to a softer interlude punctuated by sudden loud outbursts, still rooted in B minor and closing with a strong resolution. The music then shifts into a restless, agitated passage that sequences through distant keys—D major, F sharp minor, A major, and others—using bold harmonic progressions including French augmented sixth chords, before settling into a lyrical stretch in F sharp major colored by a flattened sixth. It circles back to B minor with mounting intensity, driven by a dominant pedal and fragmented diminished harmonies. The main theme reappears once more in its original dramatic guise, followed by an extended interlude that begins gently but grows increasingly turbulent, culminating in a decisive cadence. The movement concludes with a coda steeped in B minor, where a sustained dominant note builds expectation before resolving firmly to the tonic; a final echo of the opening’s haunting half-diminished chord lingers beneath the tonic bass, closing the work with a shadow of its initial unease.
