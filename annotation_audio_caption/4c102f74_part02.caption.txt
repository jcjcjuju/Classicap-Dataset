The music moves through a series of shifting tonal colors, beginning with a somber, dotted-rhythm theme—recognizable from the opening—now cast in F sharp minor, then briefly brightening in E major before slipping into the darker hues of C sharp minor. A restless passage of triplet motion follows, echoing the earlier transition’s rhythmic energy, first in C sharp minor and then in D major, building tension that resolves dramatically with a rich, dissonant chord that strongly pulls back toward the home key. This leads into a more stable passage in A major, where a lyrical closing idea unfolds in echoing dialogue between the hands, interspersed with fleeting fragments of the bold opening theme.
