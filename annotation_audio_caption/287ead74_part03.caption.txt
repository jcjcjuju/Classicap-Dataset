The music begins with a bold, energetic theme now cast in the darker, more intense key of C minor, creating a heightened sense of urgency. This opening phrase soon resolves into a more stable and familiar version of the same theme, now firmly grounded in F minor—the home key—and slightly shortened, giving it a more direct and conclusive character. Following this, a lyrical, imitative passage returns, but instead of its earlier warm major-mode coloring, it unfolds in the poignant hues of F minor, lending it a new depth and expressive beauty. The section closes with a brief codetta that echoes the movement’s opening gesture, now settled securely in the tonic, bringing a sense of calm finality.
