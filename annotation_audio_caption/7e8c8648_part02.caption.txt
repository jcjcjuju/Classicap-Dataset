The music unfolds with new, exploratory material that occasionally echoes the opening theme’s contours, particularly in fleeting melodic gestures and bass patterns reminiscent of the movement’s beginning. A sense of harmonic restlessness prevails as the music drifts through brief glimpses of C major and A minor before settling more decisively into A minor. From there, it wanders through F major and D minor, creating a chain of shifting tonal colors, until it gravitates toward C minor and then resolves into the stability of C major. Throughout, rich harmonic colors emerge, including a striking inverted dominant ninth chord in G major, rendered in both diatonic and chromatic forms. The section closes with a passage built over the dominant note, shifting from the shadowy tension of C minor to the brighter clarity of C major, leading smoothly into the return of the opening theme.
