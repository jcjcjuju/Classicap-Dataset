A bold, self-contained theme unfolds in the home key, presenting a clear eight-bar idea that concludes with a strong sense of resolution; this theme then returns immediately with subtle alterations, retaining its confident character. A new melodic idea follows, beginning in the same key but quickly shifting upward in pitch and modulating to a brighter, closely related key, where it ends with a feeling of suspension rather than closure. In this new key, a contrasting theme emerges, built from repeated fragments of its own opening gesture, each restatement gently reshaped; as it nears its close, the harmonic rhythm slows, stretching two chords across twice their original duration to create a lingering, expansive effect. A brief connecting passage then sustains a single pitch in both high and low registers, which initially feels stable but gradually transforms into a tense, expectant harmony that points toward a new tonal center. Finally, the opening bold theme reappears in its original key, reaffirming its presence with renewed clarity.
