A stately theme in B flat major begins with a clear, balanced phrase that establishes a stable and grounded tonal center. This theme is followed by a contrasting episode that introduces new melodic material, creating a sense of departure. The opening theme then returns, subtly altered but still rooted in the same key, preserving its essential character while offering slight variation. The section concludes with a brief coda that reinforces the home key, providing a sense of finality before the music circles back.
