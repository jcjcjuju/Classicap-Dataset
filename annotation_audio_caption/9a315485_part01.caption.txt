A bold, somber theme in C minor opens the music, unfolding with a sense of urgency before arriving at a more unsettled, expectant close in G minor. This is followed by a contrasting passage that weaves fragments of the opening theme into a restless, developmental episode. The main theme then returns, now reshaped and firmly reestablished in its original key of C minor, bringing a sense of resolution and stability to the close.
