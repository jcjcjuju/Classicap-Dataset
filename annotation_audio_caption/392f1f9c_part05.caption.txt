A somber, yearning melody unfolds in G minor, supported by a persistent dominant note in the bass that creates a sense of unresolved tension. The theme echoes an earlier passage with its rising gestures and expressive harmonic color, now imbued with a restrained intensity. This tension builds through repeated attempts to reach resolution, only to be gently deflected, until it finally finds release in a clear, conclusive cadence that settles firmly into the home key.
