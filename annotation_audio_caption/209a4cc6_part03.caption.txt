The music returns to the opening material: a bold theme begins not in the home key but in its dominant, creating an immediate sense of gentle tension, and soon settles into a stable, warm tonality. This theme is then varied and extended, followed by a flowing episode built from its rhythmic essence, unfolding in a sequence that feels both familiar and freshly developed. The main theme reappears transformed—first in the lower register with a light, running accompaniment above, then in the upper voice with the accompaniment below—before closing with a brief, conclusive passage that wraps up the section with quiet finality.
