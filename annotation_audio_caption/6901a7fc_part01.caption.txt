The music begins with a clear, stable tonal center, soon shifting to a brighter, related key before briefly hinting at a more tense harmonic area. A short, recurring melodic idea is passed between the upper voices over a continuously moving bass line, creating a sense of interplay and forward motion. This section closes with an unresolved pause that leaves the harmony hanging expectantly. The following section unfolds through a series of sequential patterns that wander through various tonal areas, using quicker, more compact imitative figures. It ultimately arrives at a surprising and luminous major-key conclusion, despite the prevailing minor mode, and ends with a brief closing gesture that echoes the earlier unresolved pause but now brings a sense of finality.
