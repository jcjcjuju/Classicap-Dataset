A bold, concise theme in A major opens the movement, sounding stable yet ending with a sense of suspension on the dominant. This idea is immediately echoed at the start of the following passage, which then shifts into the brighter key of E major, unfolding with restless energy and hinting at a new melodic figure before pausing unexpectedly without resolution. That hinted idea then blossoms into a lyrical second theme in E major, unfolding in two phrases—first a balanced four-bar statement, then a slightly extended five-bar response—anchored firmly by the home and dominant harmonies of its key. The section closes with a sustained harmonic grounding in E major, followed by a striking double pedal point that lingers beneath the texture.
