A bold, lyrical theme begins in the lowest voice, establishing a stable home base in E flat major. This idea is immediately answered in a higher voice, shifting to the brighter, more tense sound of B flat major, with no accompanying counter-melody. A brief linking passage smoothly returns the music to E flat before the main theme reappears in a middle voice, followed by another answer in the highest register, again in B flat. The music then flows into a short interlude that extends the sense of B flat before unexpectedly bringing back the answer in E flat, now layered with the original theme entering just a beat later in the bass—creating a tightly woven, overlapping texture. This imitative intensity continues as the answer sounds in a middle voice while the theme simultaneously begins again in the top voice, producing a dense, intricate web of sound. A new transitional passage follows, introducing a fleeting shift to the darker, unsettled mood of C minor before resolving back to the warmth of E flat, where a slightly modified version of the main theme emerges in a middle voice. The answer then returns in the highest register, once more in B flat, but is quickly joined by the theme in the bass in E flat, overlapping again in close succession. The movement concludes with a quiet closing passage that recalls a distinctive fragment of the main theme in its final moments, firmly anchored in the home key.
