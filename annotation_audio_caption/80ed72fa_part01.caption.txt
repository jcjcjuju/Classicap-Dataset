The music opens with a bold, four-bar theme in F minor that creates a sense of urgency, ending with a strong pull toward its dominant. This theme immediately returns, shifted up by a semitone, and settles into the warmer, more luminous key of D flat major through a striking harmonic shift. Fragments of the opening idea are then restated in the original key, leading to a distinctive rhythmic figure reminiscent of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. The entire section concludes with a clear suspension on the dominant, leaving a feeling of unresolved tension. A transitional passage follows, echoing the opening theme before introducing a new triplet-based pattern that hovers over a sustained bass note, gradually guiding the harmony toward the relative major key. There, a lyrical second theme emerges—its opening gesture subtly echoing the initial motif—but soon shifts into the darker, more somber tones of A flat minor for its contrasting continuation. The exposition closes with a brief coda that wraps up the thematic material.
