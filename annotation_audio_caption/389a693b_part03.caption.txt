A bold, energetic theme returns in its original home key, now streamlined and without the earlier modulations to distant tonal areas. This leads into a much briefer transitional passage that shifts harmonic direction, building tension toward a new tonal goal. A lyrical second theme then unfolds, first in a bright major mode, then echoed with a darker, minor inflection, before resolving into the reassuring stability of the home key. This thematic material continues through a series of sequential patterns that weave through changing harmonies, ultimately arriving at an extended closing section that lingers on the home tonality with a sense of finality.
