The exposition opens with a theme in E flat major that begins with a gentle harmonic shift, unfolding a distinctive three-note motif—“Le-be-wohl”—first heard in a flowing sequence and then echoed in the bass with a dotted rhythm. This theme is structured in two balanced parts, the second of which returns shortly after in a connecting passage that weaves the same motif through interlocking melodic lines moving in opposite directions. The “Le-be-wohl” idea resurfaces again, now simultaneously upright in the lower register and flipped upside-down in the upper, and later stretched out with its first note held longer. A new lyrical theme arrives in B flat major, shaped by the same motif but dramatically slowed down, its phrases echoing once an octave lower. A brief closing section follows, restating its opening gesture higher in pitch before dissolving into rapid, ornamented fragments of the core motif. The music then trails off with a quiet, searching passage that hints at the motif once more, gently guiding the ear back to the beginning for a full repeat.
