A bold, angular subject first emerges in the alto voice, establishing a stable F major home. It is answered in the treble with a slightly altered version that shifts toward C major, accompanied by a winding counter-melody in the alto. The subject then appears in the bass, now back in F major, with the counter-subject transferred to the treble. A brief interlude follows, weaving through modulations from F to C and back, built from fragments of the counter-subject. The subject returns in the treble, supported by a divided counter-subject shared between alto and bass, then reappears in the alto as an answer in C major while the treble carries the counterpoint. Again, the subject sounds in the bass with the treble providing the counter-subject in F major, and shortly after, the alto begins the subject once more while the bass completes the final portion of the counter-subject in a tightly overlapping, incomplete stretto. The music then shifts through a transitional passage that moves from F major into D minor. In this new key, the subject is heard successively in treble, alto, and bass in a tightly layered, complete stretto, culminating in a firm cadence in D minor. Without pause, the subject reappears in G minor, again in stretto form—first in the bass, then alto, then treble—leading to a conclusive close in G minor. A final episode unfolds, gradually guiding the harmony back to F major through gentle imitative exchanges and descending bass motion. The subject returns in the treble, now more ornate, with the alto immediately supplying its tonal answer, both voices intertwining in an incomplete stretto before resolving into a bright, conclusive coda in F major.
