The music begins with a unified, continuous idea that unfolds without internal breaks, culminating in a clear and resolved cadence that establishes F as a temporary point of stability. This gives way to a contrasting passage marked by harmonic restlessness, shifting through different tonal areas before settling into a brief closing section that firmly reaffirms the home key with a sense of finality.
