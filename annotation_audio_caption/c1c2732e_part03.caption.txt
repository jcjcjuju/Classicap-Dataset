A bold, eight-bar theme returns with a sense of stability, firmly rooted in the home key and closing with a clear resolution, then extended by a sustained pedal tone. This is followed by a passage of flowing scale figures that maintain the same character as before. Next, a lyrical theme—originally heard in a brighter key—now unfolds with warmth and familiarity in the home key, its phrases gently echoed and extended through subtle repetitions and brief imitative exchanges between voices. The section closes with a short, grounding pedal in the tonic, offering a quiet sense of arrival.
