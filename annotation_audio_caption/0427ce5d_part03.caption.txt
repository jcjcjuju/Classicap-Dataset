A new episode unfolds with increased rhythmic activity, featuring flowing sixteenth-note motion that begins in the stable key of A flat major. The music soon shifts to E flat major, then circles back to A flat, all while expressive appoggiaturas add subtle tension and color to the harmonies. This gives way to a passage grounded in alternating tonic and dominant seventh chords, first in A flat major, then pivoting to D flat major before returning to A flat, culminating in an unresolved, questioning cadence. The final section reaffirms A flat major with richer harmonic coloration, including brief but striking secondary seventh chords that introduce momentary brightness through raised notes, ultimately resolving with a strong and conclusive cadence that brings a sense of arrival and closure.
