A bold, energetic theme marked by a distinctive rhythmic pattern returns, now firmly rooted in D major, with the bass echoing fragments of the melody in imitation; near its close, the mood darkens as the music slips into D minor. This is followed by a contrasting lyrical theme that begins warmly in D major but gradually turns somber, shifting to D minor and resolving with a strong, conclusive cadence. The movement ends with a bright, stable closing passage in D major, underpinned by a sustained low D that anchors the harmony with a sense of finality.
