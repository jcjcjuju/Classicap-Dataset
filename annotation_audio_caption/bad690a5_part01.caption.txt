A bold subject in D major is first heard in the tenor, immediately answered in the alto with a real answer that shifts the tonal center to A major; a brief codetta follows before the subject returns in the treble, now in D major again, and is swiftly overlapped by its answer in the bass, creating a tight contrapuntal weave. A flowing episode then unfolds, shifting through A and D before settling back in A, after which the subject emerges in E minor in the alto, answered in B minor by the treble, leading to another codetta that guides the harmony back to A major. The texture intensifies with a close stretto between alto and treble in D major, followed by a second episode that modulates from D to A. The subject reappears in B minor in the tenor, quickly overlapped by its answer in the treble and an altered version in the alto, all within B minor, before a codetta pivots the music to F sharp minor, where the answer sounds in the bass. A new stretto in D major layers the answer in the bass, treble, and alto in rapid succession, separated by just one beat, while a fragment flickers in the alto. Another episode carries the harmony from D to G, setting up a three-voice stretto in G major where the subject enters in quick succession in tenor, alto, and treble. A final episode modulates from G back to D, allowing the subject to resound clearly in the tenor in D major, followed by a short codetta and two fragmented answers in the bass and tenor in A major. The music then builds to a climactic stretto in which all four voices enter in rapid succession—treble, alto, tenor, and bass—interweaving the answer and subject between A major and D major, culminating in a bright, stable coda firmly rooted in D major.
