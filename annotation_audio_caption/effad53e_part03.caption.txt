A bold, rhythmically incomplete theme returns in the home key, establishing a familiar sense of stability. This is followed by a transitional passage that reworks earlier material, now steering the harmony toward the dominant rather than a distant key, creating a more direct path back to the central tonality. A lyrical second theme then unfolds entirely within the home key, sounding more resolved and integrated than before. The movement concludes with a final section that closely mirrors the earlier coda, now firmly anchored in the tonic, lending a satisfying sense of closure.
