The movement opens with a somber, eight-bar theme in G minor that establishes a stable yet unresolved mood, ending with a pause that creates a sense of anticipation. This theme is immediately echoed in the next section, but only its first half returns before the music shifts direction, moving through harmonic changes that lead to a brighter key—F major—setting up a new tonal area. A lyrical two-bar phrase then emerges in B flat major, light and songlike, and is heard three times: first as stated, then higher in pitch, and once more at the original level, each time overlapping seamlessly into a longer four-bar idea that unfolds with gentle variation and expansion. The closing bars revisit the opening gesture of this lyrical theme, offering a brief, reflective conclusion before the entire section is marked to be played again.
