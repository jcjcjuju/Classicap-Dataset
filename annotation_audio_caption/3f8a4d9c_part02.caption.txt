A lyrical theme in A minor unfolds with a gentle, flowing character, concluding with a shift toward E minor that creates a subtle sense of departure. This theme returns later, now reshaped to settle firmly back into the home key of A minor, restoring a feeling of stability. Between these statements, the music enters a developmental passage that explores and transforms earlier material with greater harmonic restlessness. The entire section is then presented again in full, not as a literal repeat but as a rewritten version that closely follows the original path while introducing small, nuanced changes near its conclusion.
