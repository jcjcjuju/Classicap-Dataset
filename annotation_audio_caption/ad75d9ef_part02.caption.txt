A restless, searching episode unfolds, built from a motive reminiscent of earlier sixteenth-note motion, now accompanied by rapid harmonic shifts and intricate part-writing. The music moves through a chain of minor keys—A, E, B, F-sharp, back to E, then D and G minor—each transition marked by unexpected harmonic turns, including striking uses of the Neapolitan sixth and inverted seventh chords that create moments of heightened tension and color. This harmonic instability culminates in a strong arrival on the dominant of D major, setting up a brief, anticipatory link that smoothly leads back to the return of the main themes.
