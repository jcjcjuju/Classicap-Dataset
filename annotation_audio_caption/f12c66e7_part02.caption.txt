The music shifts into a darker, unsettled mood in A flat minor, with the accompaniment now flowing in continuous triplets. Soon, a striking harmonic twist leads to a bright, unexpected key—E major—where a bold, energetic theme, previously heard in the home key, now resurfaces with renewed character. Another sudden shift follows, dissolving this brightness into a tense, complex chord that pulls strongly toward E flat, unfolding through rich, dissonant harmonies that create a mounting sense of anticipation. This tension builds steadily, driving forward until it resolves into the return of the main theme in its original, stable tonality.
