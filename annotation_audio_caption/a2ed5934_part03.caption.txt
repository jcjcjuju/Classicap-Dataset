A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key of E flat major, though its opening now carries a darker, unsettled quality due to a shift to F minor harmony in the first two bars. This is followed by a transitional passage that flows smoothly without recalling earlier thematic material and leads to a point of anticipation on the dominant chord of B flat. A lyrical, contrasting theme then unfolds in the stable tonality of E flat major, introduced after a modified and lengthened connecting passage. The movement concludes with a closing section that begins with familiar arpeggiated figures now firmly grounded in the tonic key, then expands with new material derived from the opening theme, bringing the piece to a resolved and resonant finish.
