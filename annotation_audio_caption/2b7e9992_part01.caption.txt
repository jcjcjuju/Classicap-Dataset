A bold, florid theme begins in F sharp minor, soon brushing against its dominant before settling into a stable arrival in C sharp minor with a strong, conclusive cadence. This material is immediately taken up again in the same C sharp minor, now unfolding through a series of modulations—first to the darker hues of B minor, then brightening into the warm, open sound of A major, where it lingers with emphasis through a clear and satisfying cadence. The music then shifts toward C sharp major, ending this section with an unresolved, expectant pause. A brief, simple bass line bridges into a return of the opening idea, now back in the home key of F sharp minor; it briefly veers toward B minor once more before circling back to F sharp, passing through a tense dominant harmony that sets up a final, emphatic resolution in the tonic, closing with a quiet but firm sense of arrival.
