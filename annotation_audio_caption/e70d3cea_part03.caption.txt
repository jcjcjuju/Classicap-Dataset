A bold, energetic theme returns, firmly rooted in the home key, followed by a transitional passage that moves from a bright, resonant E major to a darker C sharp minor. The second theme then unfolds in the luminous tonic major, but soon shifts into the somber tonic minor, its character transformed after its initial statement. The movement concludes with a coda that echoes the opening theme in a low, resonant voice beneath the surface texture.
