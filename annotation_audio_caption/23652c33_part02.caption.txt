The music opens with a passage that echoes the early gestures of the connecting episode, unfolding with a sense of searching instability before settling into a clear, stable area in E flat major. A brief continuation in the same key follows, maintaining this grounded feeling. Then, a tightly woven imitative texture emerges: a subject derived from the opening bold theme is treated fugally, soon joined by a countersubject that subtly recalls the initial notes of the lyrical second theme, creating a complex interplay of familiar ideas. Later, a distinct musical phrase appears and is immediately restated, now transposed through a series of shifting harmonic centers, producing a cascade of tonal color. A fleeting echo of the movement’s original closing theme briefly surfaces, offering a moment of recognition before the texture shifts again. Finally, the fugal treatment of the opening theme returns with renewed intensity, its layered entries building momentum and tension as it drives toward a full restatement of the primary theme.
