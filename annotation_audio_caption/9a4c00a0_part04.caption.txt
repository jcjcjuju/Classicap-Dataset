A bold, energetic theme—originally introduced earlier in the movement—returns in a bright D major, now sounding in the lower register and slightly condensed. It is soon mirrored upside-down in G major, then again inverted and subtly reshaped within an inner voice. This gives way to a passage built from fragments of the same theme, culminating in a resonant A major chord, followed by a new imitative section in D major that weaves the material through overlapping entries. The music then shifts back to the home key of B flat major, where the main theme reappears in shortened form across different voices, now intertwined with motifs from the preceding episode. Simultaneously, inverted and direct versions of the theme answer each other between upper and lower registers, creating a dense web of imitation. This intricate play of familiar ideas continues in varied contrapuntal forms, steadily building toward a strong, conclusive cadence in the tonic key. The movement closes with a sustained harmonic foundation: first a low E flat, then joined by a B flat, forming a resonant double drone over which echoes of the main theme and its companion counter-melody unfold, finally resolving with quiet certainty into the home key.
