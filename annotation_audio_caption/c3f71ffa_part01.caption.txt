A bold, stable theme unfolds over a sustained harmonic foundation, its initial phrase grounded in the home key before extending through a repeated melodic idea that shifts upward in pitch. This leads seamlessly into a transitional passage that initially echoes the opening theme but soon begins to wander through distant tonal areas—first brightening into a new major key, then briefly brushing against others before settling into a darker, minor-key half-cadence that creates a sense of unresolved anticipation. From this point emerges a contrasting lyrical theme in a warmer, major-key realm, introduced with a gentle melodic sequence that is soon echoed throughout all voices in close imitation; later, this melody returns transformed, its contour flipped upside down while retaining its expressive character. The section closes with a brief codetta that recalls the movement’s opening gesture in the upper voice while the lower voice draws from earlier transitional material, wrapping up the exposition with a concise synthesis of what has come before.
