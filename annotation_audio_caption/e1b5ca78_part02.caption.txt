The music begins with a fragment of the bold, energetic first theme, now heard in the brighter key of F major. This gives way to a brief allusion to the more lyrical second theme, before the opening theme returns in a new, sharper tonal color—C major. A fresh musical idea then emerges, distinct in character, followed by flowing scale passages that build momentum and gradually steer the harmony back toward the home key, arriving with a sense of resolution.
