The music begins with a clear echo of the movement’s opening theme, immediately recognizable by its distinctive three-note call. This idea, imbued with a sense of longing, becomes the central thread throughout this section, unfolding through varied harmonic landscapes and rhythmic treatments. The same three-note figure—now transformed, fragmented, and recontextualized—pervades the texture, sometimes in the bass, sometimes inverted or reshaped, driving the music forward with persistent thematic unity while exploring distant tonal areas and building tension through continuous development.
