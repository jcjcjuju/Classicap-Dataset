A bold, energetic theme in D major returns, largely unchanged from its initial appearance but with its inner voices flipped upside down in one passage, creating a fresh yet familiar contour. This leads into a closing section that begins by unfolding and reshaping a distinctive fragment from the theme into new rhythmic and melodic shapes. A fleeting shadow of the theme then appears in the darker hue of D minor before the music gathers strength, presenting the opening gestures of the main theme once more—now richly transformed—and drives toward a decisive, stable conclusion in D major, which echoes and elaborates on that final resolution until the movement’s end.
