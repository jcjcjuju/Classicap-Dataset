A bold, energetic theme in A major unfolds over eight bars, creating a sense of openness as it pauses on a half-cadence; this theme returns immediately, varied in its details, and now resolves with a strong, conclusive full cadence. A contrasting lyrical idea follows in the same key, soon shifting toward a brighter, more expectant tonal area that settles into a stable, resonant full cadence in E major, which is then gently prolonged through repeated cadential gestures. The opening energetic theme reappears once more, now reshaped with fresh ornamentation and rhythmic nuance, yet retaining its essential character.
