A bold, energetic theme returns, firmly rooted in the home key, unfolding with a steady four-bar pulse before flowing into a passage where rapid sixteenth-note figures shift from treble to bass, followed by slurred eighth-note patterns that echo between the hands. This leads seamlessly into a transitional passage that maintains the rhythmic and motivic character of the opening theme, alternating harmonically before settling decisively into the home key. A contrasting lyrical idea then emerges, now also in the home key, built from repeated triplets and delicate melodic fragments; it unfolds in three distinct waves—first with poised symmetry ending in a half-cadence, then developing through imitative exchanges and modulatory sequences that briefly touch distant tonal colors, and finally expanding with chromatic harmonies and inverted repetitions that stretch the phrase toward a series of emphatic cadences. The movement concludes with two stark, final chords marked as a coda.
