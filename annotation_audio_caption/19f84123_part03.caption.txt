A bold, energetic theme rooted in G major returns, grounded by a sustained bass note that gives it a stable, resonant quality. This is followed by a transitional passage built from the same melodic and harmonic material as heard earlier, but now reshaped to guide the music toward D major instead of away from it. The lyrical second theme then unfolds, now comfortably settled in the home key of G major, lending it a sense of arrival and resolution. A brief linking passage follows, creating momentum that either circles back to earlier sections or, with slight alteration, ushers in a final coda. In this closing section, fragments of the opening theme echo in the lower register, heard twice, then reappear in the upper register a step higher, leaving a lingering impression of the movement’s primary idea.
