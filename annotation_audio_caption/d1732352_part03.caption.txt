A bold, fugal theme in F major returns, now paired with a flowing scale passage. This leads into a contrasting episode that begins with a somber four-bar phrase in G minor, which is then heard again in G minor and shifts to B-flat major. A dazzling variation of the opening theme emerges from B-flat minor, building momentum until it lands firmly on a dominant chord, creating strong anticipation. The music then settles into a lyrical, sustained melody—the second subject—now grounded in the home key of F major, where it unfolds with added length to form a brief, conclusive coda.
