The music begins with a stable, grounded feel as a sustained bass note anchors the opening passage, over which melodic figures unfold. This foundation shifts to a new sustained bass note that creates a sense of building tension, leading to a clear and resolved arrival in a brighter, related key. A new section follows, starting confidently in this brighter key but soon veering through more shadowed, minor harmonies before firmly reestablishing the same bright key, now reinforced by a steady bass and layered melodic lines moving in stepwise descent; the section closes with a strong, conclusive cadence in this key, marked by added harmonic richness. The music then moves into a gentler, more introspective mood, drifting from the established brightness into a somber minor key, where it settles with a quiet but definite cadence. From this reflective point, the harmony begins to shift again—first touching on the earlier brightness, then decisively returning to the original home key. A series of descending melodic patterns unfolds, creating a sense of gentle momentum, before the music settles onto a steady, anchoring bass note in the home key. Over this foundation, the texture thickens, and the harmony grows richer, culminating in a final, assured cadence that brings the entire movement to a restful close in its original tonal center.
