A bold, somber theme in C minor unfolds, establishing a stable yet intense mood, followed by an extended continuation that deepens its character. This gives way to a contrasting episode built from a short phrase first heard in F minor, then immediately restated with subtle changes in the brighter key of E flat major. A lyrical second subject emerges in E flat major, offering warmth and contrast, and gradually extends its expressive reach. From this, a transitional passage grows, drawing material from the second subject to build momentum and tension, ultimately steering the music back toward the home key with a strong dominant seventh chord. The opening theme then returns in its original C minor form, reaffirming its initial gravity and drive.
