A bold, energetic theme returns, now reshaped: its opening phrase is heard in the home key, then immediately restated in a darker, minor mode, creating a sense of harmonic motion. This is followed by a contrasting continuation that settles into a brighter, related key, differing from its earlier version. The thematic presentation unfolds with the first idea now heard twice and the second only once, altering the original balance. A transitional passage follows, identical to its earlier appearance, smoothly guiding the music forward. Finally, a lyrical second theme enters in the home key, unfolding in two distinct parts—the first expansive and songlike, the second a concise, varied response—both resolving with a grounded sense of arrival.
