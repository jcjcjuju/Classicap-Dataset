A bold, balanced theme in B flat major unfolds with a clear sense of structure, beginning with a four-bar idea that ends with a gentle pause before continuing with a slightly extended reply that firmly establishes the dominant key. This is followed by a brief, chromatic transition that winds back to the home key, arriving at a moment of poised anticipation. The opening theme then returns, now fully grounded in the tonic, with its initial gesture subtly flipped in contour and its closing phrase adjusted to reaffirm the stability of B flat major with a satisfying final cadence.
