A bold, lyrical theme in A flat major unfolds, establishing a stable, grounded feeling before concluding with a strong sense of finality; this theme then returns immediately, restated with subtle variation and shifted slightly higher in pitch, creating a brighter resonance. A contrasting passage follows, introducing a darker, more restless mood in F minor, which soon shifts toward a brighter, expectant quality as the music moves into E flat major. The opening theme then reappears once more in its original form and key, reaffirming its initial stability and character without alteration.
