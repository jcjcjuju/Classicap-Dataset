A lyrical theme in D flat major unfolds with a gentle, stable character, later shifting toward A flat major and creating a subtle sense of departure. This material returns immediately after, varied in its details but retaining its essential shape. A brief developmental section follows, tightly woven from fragments of the opening theme, introducing a fleeting sense of exploration and mild tension. The main theme then reappears, now reshaped to reaffirm D flat major as a point of resolution. This developmental and thematic sequence recurs once more, leading into a short transitional passage that gently guides the harmony away from D flat major and back toward the home key of F minor.
