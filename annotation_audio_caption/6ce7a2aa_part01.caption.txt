The music opens with a clear, stable theme in A flat major, built from two short two-bar ideas followed by a longer four-bar phrase that creates a sense of gentle suspense by pausing on the dominant. This entire sequence returns with subtle changes, now resolving firmly to a point of rest in the home key. A brief transitional passage follows, starting with a somber two-bar idea in B flat minor that immediately reappears in the brighter A flat major; this material is then echoed and reshaped to guide the harmony toward E flat major. There, a new lyrical theme unfolds in a four-bar span, soon returning with variation, and is followed by another expressive phrase that also comes back transformed, ultimately settling into a strong, conclusive cadence in E flat major.
