A bold, energetic theme in C minor returns, now presented without its earlier extension. This is followed by a brief episode that develops material from the theme’s sixth and seventh bars, repeating a short phrase in sequence before shifting mood through a striking augmented sixth chord that leads into a warm, lyrical second subject in C major. A transitional passage then unfolds, elaborating and extending earlier connecting material, before the opening theme reappears once more in C minor, this time with a shortened and varied version of its continuation. The movement concludes with a coda that begins by transforming a fragment of the second subject into an extended, reflective line; this gives way to a darker passage in C minor, which builds tension through a Neapolitan sixth chord, pauses dramatically, and then briefly recalls the main theme in A flat major before resolving back to C minor via another augmented sixth. The piece ends with a somber, descending line in the harmonic minor scale.
