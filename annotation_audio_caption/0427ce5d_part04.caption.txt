A gently syncopated main theme returns, now transposed lower and beginning in D flat major, with its harmonies enriched by appoggiaturas; it sequences toward A flat major before shifting into the darker hue of D flat minor. The theme continues in the enharmonic key of C sharp minor, now accompanied by a flowing sixteenth-note countermelody in the left hand, and journeys through E major and back through C sharp minor to settle in G sharp minor with a strong cadence. A sustained dominant pedal in broken octaves unfolds over C sharp minor, creating tension that erupts into an impassioned restatement of the theme, intensified by dense textures and a chromatically descending inner voice against a bass line tracing a descending E major scale, culminating on the dominant of E major. Fragments of the main theme then reappear above a restless, agitated pedal, driving through a series of shifting tonal centers—E, F, G minor—before finally arriving at A flat major. The music quiets slightly as a dominant pedal in the bass supports a series of chromatically rising minor thirds in the upper voices, heightening anticipation.
