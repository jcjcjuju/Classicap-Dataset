A bold, angular theme in C sharp minor is first heard in the lowest voice, immediately answered in the highest voice with a version transposed to G sharp minor that mirrors the original contour without strict counterpoint. A brief connecting passage smoothly returns the music to C sharp minor, followed by the main theme stated in the middle voice. This gives way to an extended, harmonically restless interlude that weaves fragments of the theme through shifting tonal centers, eventually returning to the home key. The theme then reappears in the top voice, answered again in the middle voice in G sharp minor. The music ventures into new harmonic territory: the theme is heard in E major in the bass, then in an inverted form—flipped upside down—in B major in the top voice, followed by an inverted answer in the middle voice back in C sharp minor, and again inverted in the bass. A short cadential passage leads to F sharp major before the original theme returns in the alto in C sharp minor. Another expansive, wandering episode follows, cycling through multiple keys before the theme reemerges in the treble. A further episode modulates toward A major, where an altered inverted version of the theme appears in the alto, while the bass simultaneously presents the original form in C sharp minor. After a brief harmonic detour through G sharp minor, the answer alone sounds in the alto, preceding a final transitional passage that moves to E major and back. The theme then returns firmly in the alto in C sharp minor, followed by a slightly varied answer in the bass now in G sharp major, leading into a conclusive closing section that settles the music with a sense of finality.
