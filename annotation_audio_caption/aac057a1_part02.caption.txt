A somber, eight-bar phrase unfolds in F minor, soon brightening as it moves to the warmer relative major, A flat. This section closes with a cadence that echoes earlier endings in the movement, creating a subtle sense of familiarity. The music then shifts through an eight-bar passage that winds its way back to the darker F minor. Finally, the opening idea of this part returns, now grounded over a sustained F in the bass, slightly altered in its details, and resolves with a clear, conclusive cadence in F minor.
