A bold, slow-moving theme opens the section, its initial two-bar gesture stretched into six bars of solemn, spacious music before continuing with the same energetic material as heard earlier in the movement. This leads into a transitional passage that briefly echoes the earlier connection but quickly shifts into a dramatically different character: a free, speech-like recitative unfolds, followed by a haunting phrase in a distant, sharp-laden key, which is then restated in a slightly brighter but still unsettled minor tonality before being echoed in imitation. The music builds toward a point of tension, landing on a chord that strongly pulls toward resolution. A lyrical second theme then enters, now grounded in the home key, sounding more settled yet retaining its expressive contour, though its final bars subtly adjust their range, likely due to instrumental constraints of the time. The movement concludes with an extended closing section that gradually simplifies until only the pure, unwavering harmony of the home chord remains, resonating in quiet finality.
