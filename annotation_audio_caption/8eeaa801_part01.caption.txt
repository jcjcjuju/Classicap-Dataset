The music opens with a brief introduction built on harmonies that create a sense of anticipation, setting up a stable arrival. A bold, energetic theme then unfolds in a bright, resonant key, built from a distinctive opening idea that dominates the movement. This theme is immediately restated in an inverted and slightly altered form, reinforcing its character while settling into a clear tonal center. A contrasting idea follows, introduced in the upper voice and then echoed in a middle voice, developing from the earlier material and leading into a passage where the initial theme returns upside-down, culminating in a tightly interwoven imitation between voices at the octave. The section closes with a strong, conclusive cadence. A transitional passage begins with rapid, flowing motion derived from the main theme, shifting harmonically toward a brighter, related key before arriving on a tense, expectant chord. This leads into a new pair of phrases with a different character—first a six-bar phrase, then a shorter four-bar phrase—now colored by a darker, minor inflection. A second theme appears, clearly shaped from the opening idea of the main theme, and is promptly echoed by an inner voice a fifth below. The section wraps up with a short closing passage: a rhythmic figure in the bass is mirrored in the treble, creating a compact, echoing gesture that rounds off the exposition.
