The music opens with a bold, lyrical theme in the home key, featuring a rising scale in thirds in the upper voice, immediately echoed by a powerful octave passage in the bass that overlaps with the melody to maintain momentum through a brief pause on a sustained B flat. This theme unfolds in three clear phrases, extended by repeated cadential gestures that reinforce a sense of arrival. A new, contrasting idea follows, introducing rhythmic energy and harmonic motion that shifts the music toward a brighter, more open key, arriving at a half-cadence that creates anticipation. Out of this transition emerges a gentler, songlike melody in the new key, supported by a bass line that mirrors its contour an octave and a third lower; this idea is immediately restated at a higher pitch level, then expanded through repeated closing gestures that settle the music into a warm, stable conclusion.
