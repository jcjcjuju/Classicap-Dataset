A bold, rhythmically unsettled theme opens in a stable home key, its opening phrase feeling curiously cut short, as if trailing off mid-thought. This leads into a transitional passage that echoes a fragment of the opening idea, then unfolds through a brief sequence before settling onto a sustained bass note in a brighter, related key. A contrasting lyrical theme follows, unfolding in three distinct waves: the first gentle and flowing, the second more expansive, and the third bursting in without warning, abruptly cutting off the previous phrase’s resolution. The section closes with a final passage that recalls the middle of the lyrical theme, now anchored over a steady, repeating bass note.
