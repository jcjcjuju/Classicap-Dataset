A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key of D major, anchored by a steady bass note throughout; within this statement, a brief decorative flourish appears in the upper voice, now slightly more ornate than before. This gives way to a flowing passage of arpeggios that echoes an earlier episode but now resolves into A major instead of E major. A lyrical new theme follows, now firmly in the home key of D major, with its opening phrase passed between upper and lower voices in close imitation. A brief transitional passage then builds anticipation before the music settles into a closing section that begins with a fleeting reference to a more restless, developmental theme heard earlier; soon after, the tempo quickens to match the lively pace of the opening theme, bringing the movement to a spirited close.
