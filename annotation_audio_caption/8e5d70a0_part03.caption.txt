A fragment of the opening theme returns, now cast in a darker, minor mode and subtly reshaped. This leads into a transitional passage that briefly diverges before settling into familiar material—now grounded in the home key—featuring a recurring rhythmic figure that echoes earlier gestures. A lyrical, flowing theme follows, now centered securely in the bright, stable tonality of A major, with a slight adjustment near its close. The music then moves into an extended closing section, which at one point recalls the lyrical theme in reverse, briefly turning its contour upside down before continuing to the end.
