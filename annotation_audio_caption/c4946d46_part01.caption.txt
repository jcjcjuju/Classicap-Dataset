The music begins with a somber, focused theme in C sharp minor that builds a sense of tension as it moves toward a brighter, more assertive G sharp major before settling back into the original key. This theme then returns in a transformed version, now echoed an octave lower in a strict imitation between upper and lower voices, creating a layered, reflective texture. The section closes with a strong resolution in G sharp minor, establishing a new point of rest. From there, the music shifts into this darker G sharp minor, briefly brightening through fleeting passages in C sharp major and B major, ultimately arriving at a clear and stable cadence in E major—the relative major—bringing a contrasting warmth. A new idea then emerges, passed between voices in imitative counterpoint, guiding the harmony through F sharp minor and B minor with a sense of searching motion, until it lands firmly in F sharp minor. This gives way to a conclusive return to the home key of C sharp minor, reaffirmed with a solid cadence. Finally, the opening theme reappears in its original form and key, now surrounded by more animated and lively accompanying figures, while a descending sequence in the bass—derived from earlier motifs—unfolds beneath intricate, flowing lines in the upper parts, leading to a final restatement of the secondary theme, now introduced with a quick three-note flourish and echoed across the voices before the music settles once more into C sharp minor.
