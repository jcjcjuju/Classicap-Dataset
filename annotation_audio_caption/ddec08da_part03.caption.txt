A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, now enriched by a highly ornate bass line in its latter half. This leads into a transitional passage that shifts harmonically to prepare the dominant key, followed by a lyrical second theme now firmly grounded in the tonic. The movement concludes with a coda that first recalls a tense, harmonically static passage built on dominant harmony, then revisits the opening theme, and finally settles into a calm, resonant close with sustained bass tones under gentle subdominant-to-tonic harmonies that evoke a peaceful resolution.
