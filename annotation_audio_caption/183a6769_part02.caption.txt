The music begins with a somber, transformed version of the closing theme, now in a minor key, creating a darker mood. This material alternates with flowing scale passages that rise and fall, echoing the motion of the earlier transitional passage. The harmony shifts restlessly through a series of keys—first settling into D minor, then moving to A minor, briefly touching C major, and returning to A minor—each shift coloring the music with a new emotional hue. The entire section builds toward a point of strong tension, culminating in a dominant seventh chord that sets up an unexpected and striking tonal destination.
