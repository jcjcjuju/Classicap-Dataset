A lyrical melody unfolds in A flat major, presenting two balanced phrases that each conclude with a clear sense of resolution in the home key. This stability gives way to a brief, darker passage in B flat minor, introducing a subtle tension. The music then shifts through a short sequential passage before embarking on a gentle harmonic journey toward the dominant key. The earlier lyrical material returns, restating the second phrase with its original warmth and clarity, reaffirming the opening mood.
