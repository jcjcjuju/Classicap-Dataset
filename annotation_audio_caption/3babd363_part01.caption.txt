The music opens with a clear, stable theme in the home key, built from balanced four-bar phrases and underpinned by a sustained bass note that reinforces a sense of grounding. Lively sixteenth-note flourishes first appear in the upper voice, then shift to the lower register, followed by smooth, slurred eighth-note figures that also migrate from top to bottom. This material flows into a transitional passage that echoes the opening theme’s rhythms, now unfolding over another steady bass tone while the harmony shifts between two closely related keys before settling into a brighter, more expectant key with a teasing, unresolved cadence. A new lyrical idea then emerges in this brighter key, introduced by a distinctive triplet rhythm and a delicate melodic fragment; its second half expands with an added introductory gesture before arriving at a firm, conclusive cadence. This is followed by a contrasting section where the melody is shared between voices and cycles through a series of keys in a tightly woven sequence, creating a sense of wandering tension heightened by a rich, chromatic chord. The final section begins with a fresh melodic idea that briefly dips into a darker key, supported by an unusual succession of dissonant, chromatically shifting chords. After a strong resolution, this material returns upside-down and extended, incorporating echoes of earlier phrases now with inverted voicing, all culminating in repeated, emphatic cadences in the brighter key.
