A bold, energetic theme in D minor unfolds in two balanced phrases—one grounded in the home key, the next drifting through brighter harmonies before settling into a related minor tonality—then returns with subtle adjustments to reaffirm the tonic. This material reappears later with variation, preserving its essential character while reshaping its harmonic path. The movement concludes with a coda that weaves together echoes of both the main theme and its contrasting ideas, bringing the piece to a cohesive close.
