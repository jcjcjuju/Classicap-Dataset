A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key of F minor, its first portion now reshaped with fresh variation while retaining its essential character; this is followed by the second portion of the theme, heard exactly as before, reaffirming the tonic with stability and drive. A transitional passage follows, echoing the earlier connecting episode but soon shifting into the distant, richly colored key of D flat major, whose harmony subtly prepares the return of the next theme. That theme—originally heard in C minor—now unfolds in the home key of F minor, lending it a darker, more resolved quality. This leads into a closing section built from the movement’s opening idea, creating a sense of temporary arrival, yet it does not conclude the piece; instead, it flows into a brief passage that unexpectedly circles back to earlier material before launching into a final, swift coda. This ultimate closing section introduces a new two-part idea—first grounded in F minor, then shifting to the luminous key of A flat major—before culminating in a powerful restatement of the movement’s initial theme, now transformed into a driving, decisive finale.
