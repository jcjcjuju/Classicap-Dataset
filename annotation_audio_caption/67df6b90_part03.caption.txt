A bold, energetic theme returns, beginning in E minor and quickly shifting through related keys before settling back into the home key with a clear sense of arrival. This is followed by a transitional passage that weaves through various tonal centers—now reshaped to guide the music firmly back to E minor—featuring lyrical fragments that echo earlier material. The second theme then appears, now grounded in the stable, resonant sound of E minor, preserving its original character but with a newfound sense of resolution. The movement concludes with an extended closing section that lingers on the tonic, reinforcing the home key with a sustained, conclusive presence.
