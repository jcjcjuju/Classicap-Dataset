The music begins with a flowing pattern of eighth and sixteenth notes, creating a continuous, intricate motion. A bright, stable resolution is heard as the opening section closes in E-flat major, giving a sense of arrival and completeness. The following section starts from this point of calm but soon moves through shifting harmonic colors—first a somber turn into C minor, then a warmer glow in A-flat major, followed by a darker hue in F minor—before finally settling back into the home key with a grounded, conclusive tone. Throughout, the texture remains tightly woven from the initial rhythmic figures, with subtle ornamental flourishes and sequences that echo and transform the opening material.
