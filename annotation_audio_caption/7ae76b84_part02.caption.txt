The music begins with a bold, assertive idea derived from the movement’s opening theme, now combined with a short three-note gesture from the second subject’s middle section, all unfolding in the bright key of F major. A brief shadow passes through G minor before the passage snaps decisively into F minor with a striking, unexpected shift in mood. This cadence echoes an earlier closing phrase—now transformed by its new, darker tonality—before the texture shifts to rapid sixteenth-note figures intertwined with the original opening motif. The harmony grows restless, moving through C minor, B-flat major, and G minor, where a questioning half-cadence lingers, repeated insistently. The tension then gathers over a dominant pedal in B-flat, the music flickering between major and minor modes, creating a sense of anticipation that pulls clearly toward the return of the main theme.
