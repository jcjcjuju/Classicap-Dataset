The music opens with a bold, structured theme in the home key, unfolding in two uneven phrases: the first creates a sense of suspension by ending inconclusively, and the second echoes it but expands slightly before resolving firmly. This gives way to a striking contrast—a gentle, lyrical passage where a simple melodic idea is softly repeated three times. A brief shift into a darker, minor tonality follows, then returns with subtle alterations to reaffirm the home key with a strong, satisfying close, underscored by a sustained bass note that lingers peacefully. The mood then shifts as the music transitions: the lower and upper voices echo each other in a close, imitative dialogue, first in a minor mode, then brightening into a major key through a series of sequential patterns that build anticipation, halting just before resolution. What follows is a new theme introduced in a somber minor key, enriched with expressive dissonances like the augmented sixth and the unexpected use of a minor seventh within the harmony; it concludes with a surprising turn to major—the so-called “Tierce de Picardie”—ushering in a brighter, more expansive continuation. This second part unfolds as a single lyrical idea that returns with embellishment, its closing gestures drawn out with ornamental flourishes, while fleeting sixteenth-note figures subtly recall the movement’s very first theme.
