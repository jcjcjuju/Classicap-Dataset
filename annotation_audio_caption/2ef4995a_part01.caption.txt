The music opens with a bold, structured theme in the home key, unfolding in two balanced phrases: the first creates a brief sense of departure by shifting toward a brighter, related key, while the second firmly returns to establish a stable, conclusive feeling. This is followed by a transitional passage that carries forward the thematic material into a new key, maintaining continuity while preparing for contrast. A gentler, lyrical idea then emerges in this brighter key, offering a clear shift in mood. After a short connecting passage that subtly leads back, the opening theme returns, now subtly reshaped—its character familiar but freshly nuanced—restating its confident presence before the section draws to a close.
