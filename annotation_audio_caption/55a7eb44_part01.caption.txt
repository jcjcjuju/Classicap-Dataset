A bold, rhythmically shifting theme unfolds in a stable home key, beginning with a distinctive three-bar pattern that later settles into a more regular two-bar flow, rich with echoing imitations and flipped melodic shapes. This gives way to a brief, rising sequence that climbs brightly in the upper register, followed by a contrasting lyrical idea in a brighter, related key, which is subtly shadowed by fragments of the opening theme in the accompaniment. A short transitional passage then emerges over a sustained harmonic anchor, smoothly guiding the music back toward the home key before the opening theme returns in full, reaffirming its presence with renewed clarity.
