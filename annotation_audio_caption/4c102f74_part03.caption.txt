A bold, energetic theme with dotted rhythms and a steady stream of eighth notes returns in the home key of A major, now subtly reshaped in its voicing and register. This is followed by a fleeting transitional passage that reintroduces triplet rhythms and leads smoothly into a lyrical second theme, which begins as it did earlier but quickly settles into A major; within this stable tonality, fleeting shadows pass through A minor and F major before returning to brightness. The section closes with a winding, chromatically colored theme over a persistent A in the bass, reinforcing the sense of arrival and resolution.
