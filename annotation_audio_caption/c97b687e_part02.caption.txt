The section opens with a slow, speech-like passage that echoes the opening gesture of the movement—solemn and sparse, unfolding with a sense of improvisatory freedom. This gives way to a faster, more driven passage whose character closely resembles the energetic, stepwise-moving theme introduced earlier in the connecting episode; this material, also rooted in the movement’s initial motif, now propels the music forward with urgency and developmental intensity.
