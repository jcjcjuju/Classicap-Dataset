A bold, balanced theme in D major unfolds in two equal parts: the first creates a sense of departure by ending with tension in the dominant key, and the second returns firmly to a stable, resolved close in the home key. This is followed by a contrasting episode that begins with a short two-bar idea in D major, heard four times in succession as the music shifts toward A major; there, a new four-bar phrase emerges, partially echoed and concluding with a strong sense of anticipation on a dominant seventh chord. The opening theme then returns, clearly restated in its original key.
