A bold, energetic theme in G major returns, its rhythmic uniformity and stable tonality creating a sense of familiar grounding. This is followed by a melodious transitional passage that unfolds over a gradually rising bass line, now reshaped to build tension and lead decisively toward the dominant. A lyrical second theme then emerges, now firmly anchored in the home key of G major, its phrases unfolding with graceful symmetry and resolution. The movement concludes with a closing section that initially echoes earlier material before transforming into a varied statement of the opening theme, all sustained over a steady, resonant pedal point that reinforces the tonal center.
