The prelude opens with a distinctive melodic figure that shapes the entire movement. It begins in G sharp minor, establishing a somber, introspective mood, then shifts to the warmer sound of its relative major before briefly passing through the darker hues of F sharp minor and C sharp minor. This journey returns to the home key’s minor tonality before resolving firmly into D sharp minor with a strong, conclusive cadence. The music then continues in this new key, now placing the main theme in the lower register, giving it a grounded, resonant quality. Toward the end, the theme reappears in the bass as the foundation for a closing passage that settles back into G sharp minor. The piece concludes with a gentle, hymn-like resolution—a plagal cadence—ending not on the expected minor chord but on a bright major chord, offering a subtle, hopeful lift at the final moment.
