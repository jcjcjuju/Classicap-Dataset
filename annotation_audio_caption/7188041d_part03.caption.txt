The music returns to the opening material: a bold, somber theme in E minor unfolds with clear phrasing, followed by a developmental passage that explores harmonic tension and motivic fragments. This entire sequence is then restated in the same key, reaffirming its character. The movement concludes with a shift to E major, where a short, lyrical figure—derived from the original theme—echoes gently five times over a sustained low E, creating a warm, resonant close.
