A bold, energetic theme in E flat major is heard, followed by a second, closely related theme that remains in the same key, creating a sense of cohesive stability. This entire section returns exactly as before, and then gives way to a closing passage where the harmony lingers on the subdominant, producing a gentle, resonant resolution that feels like a drawn-out "amen" cadence.
