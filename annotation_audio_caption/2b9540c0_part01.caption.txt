The music opens with a stately theme in a bright, stable key, establishing a clear home base. This idea returns immediately but now cast in a darker, minor hue, creating a striking contrast. From there, the harmony shifts toward a tense, shadowy realm before resolving with unexpected warmth—a major chord emerging from minor, lending a bittersweet finality. Without pause, a new lyrical subject unfolds in a brighter, related key, marked by graceful phrases that gently cadence but withhold full closure. These phrases return with subtle variation, extending into a tender continuation that briefly dips into a more somber tonality before reaffirming the prevailing brightness. A single sustained bass note anchors a brief closing gesture, followed by a quiet harmonic nudge—a rich, expectant chord—that seamlessly guides the ear back toward the opening material.
