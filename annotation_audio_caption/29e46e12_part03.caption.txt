A bold, energetic theme unfolds in F minor, built from two balanced phrases that each create a sense of unresolved tension by ending not in the home key but in its brighter dominant major. This gives way to a restless, searching passage that sequences upward, eventually settling into the warmer relative major, A-flat, where a new melodic idea—clearly shaped from earlier material—emerges. The music then recalls the opening theme, now reshaped with altered accents and firmly grounded in the tonic key, bringing a sense of return and resolution. This entire sequence is followed by a quiet, conclusive gesture: a few simple chords in F minor that unexpectedly brighten at the very end, closing not in the expected somber minor but with a serene, major-toned final chord.
