The music begins with a calm, lyrical episode in C major, unfolding over a sustained passage that feels stable and bright. This gives way to a more intense section built entirely from the opening four bars of the second subject’s later portion—characterized by a melody that first appears in the bass, then shifts between keys with increasing urgency. The harmony moves restlessly through a series of tonal centers: from the warmth of C major into the somber shades of C minor, then to the darker hues of G minor and D minor, with a fleeting touch of A minor before arriving at F major. Within this journey, a clear sequential pattern emerges—two phrases echoing each other with rising tension—culminating in a striking, dissonant chord in D minor that adds a moment of sharp color before the passage settles onto a dominant seventh chord in F major, creating a poised sense of suspension.
