A bold subject opens in the highest voice, establishing a bright, stable tonality. It is soon answered in a lower voice with a shifted tonal center, while a new counter-melody weaves above it. The main theme then appears in the lowest voice, now accompanied by two distinct counter-melodies in the upper parts. A transitional passage follows, built on a descending pattern that smoothly shifts the tonal center, its final gesture overlapping with the next section. A new statement of the answer emerges in the top voice, supported by two contrasting counter-melodies below, one of which will not return until much later. This leads into a flowing episode characterized by a rolling, rapid figure now passed to the upper voice, guiding the music toward a darker tonal area. The subject reappears in the bass, paired with a familiar counter-melody above while the middle voice falls silent. Another transitional passage unfolds, reworking earlier material to move through shifting tonalities before arriving at a new statement of the answer in the middle voice, accompanied by two counter-melodies. A brief closing phrase in all three voices settles into a somber tonality, followed by yet another transitional passage that navigates back toward a brighter key. The answer returns in the top voice, now joined by two counter-melodies in the lower parts, and is immediately followed by the subject in the middle voice with its countersubjects inverted below and above. An extended transitional section then unfolds, cycling through multiple tonal centers using sequential patterns and frequently echoing fragments of the main subject.
