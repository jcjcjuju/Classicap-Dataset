The music opens with a bold, six-bar theme anchored by a repeating low note, its phrases unfolding through echoing imitations that stretch the line forward. A responsive idea follows—first as a brief, unresolved three-bar gesture that trails off without closure, then immediately restated in full, now rounded off with a strong, satisfying resolution. A flowing bridge takes over, its continuous triplet motion driving forward until it lands on an expectant pause in the home key. This passage includes a striking descent in the bass, where each step slides chromatically downward, creating a sense of gentle tension. The second theme enters in a brighter, higher key, beginning not in the melody but in the bass with a smooth, inverted arpeggio. Its first portion alternates between stability and motion, leaning more on the home harmony before pausing incompletely; this same idea returns moments later with its harmonic roles reversed, now closing firmly. A rising sequence follows, built on a steadily ascending bass line that climbs by half steps, while shimmering triplet figures in the upper voice recall the earlier bridge. A new, quicker motif in sixteenth notes emerges, repeated in a stepwise pattern, leading to a clear cadence. This closing idea is then extended and subtly reshaped, stretching the phrase before arriving at a final, decisive stop. The section ends with a brief, light tag that echoes the second theme’s opening shape, now slightly quicker and more ornamental.
