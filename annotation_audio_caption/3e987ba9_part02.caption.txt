The music unfolds with material derived from the bold, energetic opening theme, now reshaped and explored through shifting harmonic colors. It begins in a bright, stable key, then moves into darker, more unsettled tonalities, creating a sense of wandering and tension. This harmonic journey culminates in a strong, expectant chord that hangs with unresolved intensity, seamlessly guiding the ear back toward the return of the opening theme.
