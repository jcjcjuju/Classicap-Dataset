A new melodic idea emerges in D minor, its opening two-bar gesture immediately echoed a step lower, followed by a quieter, more subdued phrase that recalls the character of the main theme. A brief connecting passage leads into a contrasting melody in B-flat major, which shifts through G minor before arriving at an unresolved pause in F minor. After another short link, the bold, energetic theme from the opening returns, heard now in its initial twelve-bar form. This gives way to a complex episode beginning in F minor: a descending sequence unfolds with intertwined upper voices, the alto mirroring the treble a fifth below, then resolving into a calmer phrase that settles with finality in the relative major. A developmental passage follows, reshaping the opening motif through B-flat minor and A-flat major before halting on an expectant half-cadence in F minor. The earlier contrapuntal section then reappears, now firmly rooted in F minor, leading to a final brief transition.
