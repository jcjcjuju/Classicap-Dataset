A new melody unfolds in a somber, introspective mood in B minor, building toward an unresolved pause. This same melody then returns, flipped upside down and stretched out, now guiding the music toward another open-ended pause but in the brighter, yet still unsettled, key of G major. Following this, a second melody emerges in G major, shaped from the latter portion of the first melody, continuing the lyrical exploration. The music then shifts into a transitional passage that echoes earlier material, weaving through a series of key changes—touching E minor, D major, and A major—before settling back toward D major. A brief sustained note on A creates anticipation, leading into a flourish that signals the return of the main theme.
