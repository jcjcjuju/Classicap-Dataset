A bold, energetic theme unfolds in D major, driven by a persistent rhythmic pattern and accented chords that carry expressive dissonances in the top voice, resolving with a strong sense of closure. This is followed by a contrasting theme that echoes the opening rhythm but flows above a rapid, shimmering accompaniment, now in the darker hue of F sharp minor, and it trails off with a harmonic surprise rather than a full resolution.
