The music opens with a steady, grounded bass note that anchors the first few moments while a distinctive melodic figure unfolds above it, creating a sense of stability that gradually gives way to tension. This tension resolves clearly into a bright, conclusive cadence that feels like arriving at a new tonal center. A new phrase follows, carrying forward similar motivic material but now transposed and reshaped, leading to another strong cadence that lands in a more distant, softer-sounding key. The music then journeys back toward the original tonal center, restating the main idea in a transformed layout—now with the original melody inverted and appearing in different voices—before settling into a final, satisfying resolution that reaffirms the home key. The closing bars sustain a dominant tone beneath shifting harmonies, prolonging a sense of anticipation before the piece gently comes to rest.
