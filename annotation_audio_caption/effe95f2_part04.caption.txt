The music shifts to a brisker two-beat pulse, replacing the original triple meter. Two intertwining melodic lines engage in intricate counterpoint, frequently swapping roles—what was heard in the upper voice returns below, and vice versa, with subtle adjustments. This pattern unfolds in clear segments: a four-bar idea is immediately mirrored upside-down, then a new four-bar phrase follows and is similarly inverted, and finally a longer eight-bar passage is answered by its own inversion, creating a tightly woven, symmetrical design throughout.
