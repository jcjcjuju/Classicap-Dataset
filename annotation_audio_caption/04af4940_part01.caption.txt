A bold, energetic theme in G major is introduced in the highest voice, soon answered by a closely related version in the middle voice that shifts the tonal center toward D major. A brief linking passage follows in the top voice, then a contrasting counter-melody emerges above the continuing answer. Another short link leads to the theme’s return in the lowest voice, now firmly back in G major, with the counter-melody appearing in the middle voice. A flowing transitional passage modulates briefly to C major before returning to G, after which the original theme appears upside-down in the middle voice, accompanied by an incomplete inverted counter-melody below. This inverted form continues in the top voice with its counter-melody in the middle, now centered on D major, then moves to the bass with a fragmentary inverted counter-melody above in G major. A new episode unfolds with ornamental scale passages and shifting harmonies that move from G toward E minor, where the original theme reappears in the top voice, now colored by the darker mood of E minor, joined by its counter-melody in the middle voice and a brief closing gesture. The inverted theme then sounds in the middle voice, matched by an inverted counter-melody above, still in E minor. Another modulating episode carries the music further into B minor, where the theme returns in the top voice and is immediately overlapped by a tight, imitative stretto. A lively episode follows, filled with rapid thirty-second notes and modulating toward D major, where the theme enters in the middle voice without its usual companion. Above a sustained A in the bass, the theme begins again in the top voice but breaks off incomplete. A new episode features a detached bass figure while upper voices recall earlier material, leading to the inverted theme in the bass with its counter-melody in the alto, now back in G major. A two-voice episode with vigorous scales precedes the inverted theme in the alto, immediately joined by a complete stretto as the inverted theme enters in the bass. The music culminates with the original theme in the top voice, doubled in thirds below by the opening fragment of the same theme in the alto, all in G major, followed by a closing passage that settles firmly on the home key with a sustained tonic pedal in the final bars.
