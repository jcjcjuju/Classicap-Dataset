A bold, balanced theme unfolds in two equal phrases, establishing a stable home base before pausing with a sense of incompleteness. This leads into a transitional passage that gradually shifts the tonal center upward, building momentum until it arrives at a new, brighter key, where it again halts expectantly. A lyrical, songlike melody then emerges in this new key, presenting a clear eight-bar idea that feels complete in itself. This melody returns immediately, now reshaped and extended through a series of emphatic closing gestures; just as it seems about to settle conclusively, the harmony unexpectedly veers away, delaying finality and prompting further elaboration before the section closes.
