A bold, energetic theme returns, now reshaped with new harmonic colors and accompanied by a rhythmic figure reminiscent of the second subject’s opening. Its continuation unfolds with altered harmonies, building toward a pause before extending further than before, ultimately settling into the unexpected, distant key of G flat major. From there, a transitional passage emerges, weaving familiar material from earlier but recast through shifting tonalities, journeying from G flat back to the home key of B flat major. The lyrical second subject then reappears, now comfortably rooted in the tonic, its melody once again nestled within inner voices, flowing smoothly to a secure close in B flat. The movement’s final section begins with a restatement of the earlier coda material, transposed to align with the tonic, then expands with developmental elaboration, briefly recalling the coda’s initial idea before a swift scale passage introduces fresh musical content. The piece ultimately draws to a close with gentle echoes of the main theme, fading into memory.
