A bold and expansive main theme unfolds in the home key, presenting three distinct musical ideas across its extended span, each section closing with a strong, resolving cadence that reaffirms the tonal center. This is followed by a stark, momentary pause on a tense dominant seventh chord that pivots the music into a warmer, contrasting key. There, a lyrical second theme emerges, its two parts each extended through repeated cadential gestures, the latter echoing a familiar figure from an earlier movement. The music then shifts direction through a brief, modulating passage that winds back toward the home key, setting up a return of the main theme. This return begins as before but soon diverges: the final phrase is cut short and replaced by a haunting echo of the preceding motif, now colored by the dissonant tension of a diminished seventh chord, which ushers in a new, darker key.
