A bold, two-phrase theme opens in F minor, each phrase four bars long and ending with a bright, unresolved lift toward the dominant major. This gives way to a flowing, sequential passage that climbs through shifting harmonies before settling into the warmer, contrasting key of A-flat major. There, a new melodic figure emerges—clearly derived from the opening theme—now reshaped and glowing in the relative major. After a brief return to material reminiscent of the very first phrase, but with altered emphasis, the same derived figure reappears now grounded in the home key of F minor. This leads directly back to the original bold theme, restated in F minor with changed accents and reshaped to finally resolve with a sense of closure in the tonic.
