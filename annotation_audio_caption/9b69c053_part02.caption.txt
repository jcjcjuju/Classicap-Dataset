The music begins with a fragment derived from the closing notes of the main theme, unfolding into a series of shifting harmonic landscapes. A lyrical passage—originally introduced as the second half of the contrasting theme—returns multiple times, each iteration recast in a new tonal color: first in a bright major key, then shadowed by minor inflections, and later brightening again through closely related keys. This sequence creates a sense of searching instability. The tension intensifies with a dramatic passage built on a dissonant, coiled chord that conveys urgency and suspense, ultimately resolving into the return of the primary theme.
