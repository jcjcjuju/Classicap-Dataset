A bold, energetic theme in E major opens with a four-bar idea, immediately restated in octaves, followed by an eight-bar passage that shifts toward a brighter, related key before settling back into the home key, also restated in octaves. This main theme then returns in a varied form, preserving its essential character while altering some details. A brief transitional passage follows, derived from earlier material, creating a sense of movement toward a new tonal center. A contrasting second theme emerges in B major, built over a sustained harmonic foundation that creates a shimmering, expectant quality; a short phrase within this section is heard again with subtle changes. This leads into a gentler four-bar idea in B major, which returns shortly after now grounded in the original key, smoothly guiding the music back to the opening theme, which reappears exactly as first heard.
