A bold, energetic theme returns, now subtly reshaped but still rooted in the home key of E major. This leads into a transitional passage that begins with altered material in a distant key, then winds its way through harmonic tension—marked by a striking augmented sixth chord—before settling into the dominant. The lyrical second theme follows, now warmly grounded in the tonic key instead of the dominant, its phrases unfolding with gentle imitation and a momentary roughness from parallel fifths. The movement closes with a final section that echoes earlier closing material, reaffirming the home key with quiet resolve.
