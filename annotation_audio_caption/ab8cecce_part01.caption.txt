A bold, angular subject emerges in the tenor voice, establishing a somber mood in G sharp minor. It is soon answered in the alto with a tonally adjusted version that shifts the harmonic center toward D sharp minor, while the tenor introduces a complementary counter-melody. The subject then appears in the treble, now back in G sharp minor, with the alto providing the counter-subject. A deeper bass entry follows with the answer, accompanied by the counter-subject in the treble. This gives way to a brief transitional passage built from a fragment of the subject, moving smoothly from G sharp minor to D sharp minor. The answer returns in the tenor with the treble supplying the counter-subject, followed by another transition—this one more intricate, using inverted and suspended elements of the subject to shift toward C sharp minor. An unusual, unaltered answer sounds in the bass, paired with the counter-subject in the alto, before the subject reappears in the tenor without its usual companion. The answer then enters in the alto, with the tenor taking up the counter-subject once more. A new episode unfolds, driven by a distinctive rhythmic figure first introduced in the bass and echoed in the alto, steering the harmony toward D sharp minor. The subject resurfaces in the treble without the counter-subject, followed by an answer in the bass that also stands alone, now in F sharp minor. Another episode follows, reworking the same rhythmic figure in higher voices while the bass moves independently, ultimately guiding the music back toward G sharp minor. The subject returns in the tenor with its counter-subject restored in the alto, leading into a final transitional passage that weaves fragments of the subject while shifting from D sharp minor to C sharp minor. A bright answer in the treble is faintly echoed by a shadow of the counter-subject in the alto, before the music settles into a quiet, conclusive passage in G sharp minor.
