A new section begins with a bright, lyrical idea in C major, unfolding over eight bars and arriving at a clear point of arrival in G major. This material is then heard again from the start, now reshaped with subtle alterations, and followed by a further eight-bar passage that draws on the same melodic and harmonic shapes. This continuation gradually shifts the tonal center, guiding the music back toward the warm stability of E flat major.
