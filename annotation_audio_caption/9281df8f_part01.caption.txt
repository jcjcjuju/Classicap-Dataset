A bold, stable theme in E minor unfolds in two balanced sections, each affirming the home key; the second section is built over a sustained dominant tone and returns with subtle embellishments. This is followed by a connecting passage that begins with a stark, unison phrase, soon echoed with richer harmony, building anticipation through a pedal point that hints at earlier material. A new, more fluid theme then emerges in B minor, unfolding in repeating patterns before shifting to the brighter key of C major; after a brief stay, a striking dissonant chord pivots the music back to B minor, where the theme is restated with interweaving contrapuntal lines, firmly reestablishing the minor key before concluding.
