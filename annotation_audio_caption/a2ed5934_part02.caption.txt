The music opens with material that sounds like the bold, energetic theme first heard at the beginning of the movement, built from the same distinctive harmonic color—a rich, complex chord that creates a sense of instability and forward motion. This thematic idea is developed and explored throughout, shaping the entire section. As the passage unfolds, the harmony gradually shifts and intensifies, ultimately settling into a darker, more unsettled mood as it concludes with the somber quality of F minor.
