The music opens with a stable, grounded feeling as a sustained low D anchors the first two bars. A lyrical phrase unfolds above this pedal, leading smoothly to a clear, resolved cadence in the brighter key of F major. This sense of arrival is soon left behind as the music enters a more restless phase: short phrases follow one another in an ascending pattern, each echoing the shape of the last but higher in pitch, creating a feeling of gentle upward motion. This sequence briefly halts, then resumes, all while the harmony shifts through darker, more unsettled territories—first touching on a somber G minor, then an expectant A minor—before finally finding solid resolution in the home key of D major. From there, the music settles into a closing section: the home pitch D returns as a steady foundation beneath a winding, reflective line, which then gives way to a tense, sustained A that hums with anticipation before the final chords bring calm closure.
