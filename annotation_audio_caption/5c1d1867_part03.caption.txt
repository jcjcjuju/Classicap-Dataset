A bold, energetic theme in D major returns, firmly establishing the home key with its confident character. This is followed by a connecting passage that initially unfolds just as it did earlier, but soon shifts direction harmonically, arriving at A major instead of the previously heard E. The subsequent sections of this bridge continue with material identical to their earlier counterparts, though transposed higher to guide the harmony back toward D major. A lyrical second theme then emerges, now comfortably settled in the tonic key of D major, lending a sense of resolution and warmth. A brief transitional passage gently steers the music toward the final section, which anchors itself on a sustained D in the bass while weaving fragments of the opening theme into a conclusive, resonant close.
