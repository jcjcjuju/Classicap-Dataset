The music opens with a confident theme in D major, unfolding in two clear phrases: the first creates a sense of anticipation by pausing on a harmonically tense chord, and the second resolves this with a strong, stable conclusion in the home key. This material briefly continues before transforming into a linking passage that reshapes and stretches the opening idea, guiding the harmony toward a poised, expectant chord in the relative minor. A new theme then emerges in B minor, its character colored by a series of shifting tonal centers—F sharp minor, A major, and E major—before settling firmly in A major. This second theme unfolds in two parts: the first establishes a lyrical idea in A major, which is then partially echoed in the darker hue of A minor; a fresh phrase follows, its bass line echoing the opening theme’s contour, and this idea is explored and expanded until it gives way to a bright, conclusive passage in A major. The section closes with a coda featuring new musical ideas alongside a subtle nod to the initial theme, all sustained over a steady, anchoring bass note, before a transitional passage smoothly prepares for the return of the entire exposition.
