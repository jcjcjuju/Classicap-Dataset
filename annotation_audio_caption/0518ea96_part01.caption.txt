The music begins with a stable, grounded opening over a sustained bass note, establishing a clear home key. This gives way to a strong, resolved cadence that shifts the sense of tonal center upward, creating a bright and open feeling. A brief turn toward a darker, more introspective mood follows, hinting at a minor key, but the music soon regains its luminous quality, returning firmly to the original key with a conclusive cadence that simultaneously sets up anticipation for a new tonal direction. The opening idea then reappears, now transposed to a softer, more reflective key, before seamlessly guiding the harmony back to the original tonal center. The passage closes with a gentle, hymn-like resolution that evokes a sense of peaceful finality.
