A bold, elaborate theme in E minor begins in the highest voice, unfolding in four distinct gestures before a brief six-note link shifts the harmony toward B minor. The theme then reappears transposed, now in the middle voice with a contrasting counter-melody above it, creating a sense of departure. This is followed by the full theme in the lowest voice, again in E minor, now accompanied by the same counter-melody in the middle register. A new passage emerges with flowing motion, weaving fragments of the theme’s closing figure into all voices as the music shifts toward G major. The main theme returns in the top voice in this brighter key, its accompanying line subtly varied for freshness. Soon after, the transposed answer sounds in the middle voice in D major, paired with the counter-melody above. Another transitional passage builds from the theme’s latter half, guiding the harmony through shifting tonal centers toward B minor, where the full theme reappears in the bass with its familiar companion above. A further episode, similar in construction to the first, leads back toward E minor, only to give way to the theme in the alto, now supported by a bass counterpoint. A new sequential episode follows, moving through several distant keys with a steady rhythmic pulse in the bass and inventive figuration above. The theme then surfaces once more in the treble, now in A minor, with a slightly altered counter-subject. A final transitional passage, rich with imitative treatment of the theme’s closing idea in both similar and inverted forms, winds back to E minor and halts on a suspended pause. The theme’s final fragment then echoes in the bass, immediately mirrored upside-down in the treble, before the full theme resounds once more in the bass with its counter-melody, now firmly rooted in the home key. The movement closes with a reflective coda in E minor, underpinned by sustained harmonic tension that gradually dissolves into quiet resolution.
