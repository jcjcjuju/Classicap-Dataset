A bold, energetic theme—recognizable from the opening but reshaped with altered rhythms—unfolds over a flowing triplet accompaniment, initially grounded in the warm, stable sound of G major. The music then shifts decisively back to the home key of D major, where striking harmonic tension emerges through sharp, expressive chords that create a sense of urgency and color. This tension gives way to a sustained, expectant hum in the bass, over which the harmony circles insistently around the dominant note, building anticipation without immediate resolution.
