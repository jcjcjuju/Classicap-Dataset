A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, now varied with fresh detail. It gives way to a transitional passage built from the same material as the earlier episode, but now resolving securely into the tonic rather than leading away. A lyrical second theme follows, now grounded in the home key instead of the dominant, and its closing bars shift unexpectedly toward E-flat, creating a gentle harmonic surprise that ushers in a fleeting echo of the main theme. This leads directly into a more extended passage that develops the main theme’s character, building anticipation for its final return. The theme then reappears once more in a varied form, fully reestablished in the home key. The movement closes with a coda that begins with a new, distinct idea before gently recalling the opening theme in its final moments.
