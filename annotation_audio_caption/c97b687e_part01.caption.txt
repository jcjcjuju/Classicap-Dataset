The movement opens with a solemn, slow gesture that establishes a sense of unresolved tension, beginning and ending on harmonies that feel unstable yet grounded in D minor. This initial idea soon gives way to a continuation that solidifies the home key with a clear, conclusive cadence. A new theme then emerges, clearly shaped from the opening’s melodic outline, and its initial notes are echoed in the bass, climbing step by step toward a pitch that creates anticipation for a new tonal center. The music then shifts to a contrasting theme in a darker, related minor key, unfolding in two distinct spans—the first carrying rhythmic echoes of the earlier energetic material. This second theme is then developed and extended into a closing section that draws its character and shape from the contrasting theme itself. The exposition concludes with brief transitional gestures that prepare both for its own return and for the movement’s next major section.
