A bold, self-contained theme opens the piece in the home key, presenting a clear two-part idea where the second part echoes the first with added embellishment and resolves firmly instead of leaving tension. This leads into a brief connecting passage introduced by a distinctive five-note motif, whose repeated notes become a recurring reference point. The music then shifts to a contrasting theme in a brighter, related key, unfolding in two expansive sentences; the first divides neatly into balanced segments, while the second flows continuously, briefly touching on the home key before extending through repeated cadential gestures. A melodic figure from earlier returns in a slower, stretched-out form, and the section closes with a quiet three-note link that drifts into a new harmonic area, preparing for what follows.
