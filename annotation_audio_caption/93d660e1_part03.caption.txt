A bold, restless theme unfolds in a minor key, shifting through a series of contrasting tonal centers—first brightening into a relative major, then veering unexpectedly into distant keys before returning to its somber starting point. This entire sequence then reappears, followed by a closing section built over a sustained bass note; here, two intertwining melodic lines swap registers, with the lower line rising to the top while the upper line descends, creating a subtle yet striking reversal of voices.
