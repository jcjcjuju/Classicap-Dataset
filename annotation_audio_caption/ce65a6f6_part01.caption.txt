A bold, stable theme in E major opens the movement, establishing a clear sense of home. This theme concludes and is then extended with subtle variation, maintaining its grounding character. The music then shifts into a more unsettled mood, moving through E minor before settling into the brighter but still contrasting key of G major; this new material unfolds in two distinct phases, the first transitioning between those keys and the second firmly in G major. Fragments of the earlier minor-mode idea are then developed and reshaped, creating a sense of exploration, before a transformed return of the G major material appears. Finally, the opening theme comes back in its original key, restoring the initial sense of stability and familiarity.
