A clear, balanced melody unfolds in B flat major, establishing a stable and bright tonal center. This gives way to a contrasting passage that shifts to F major, creating a sense of gentle tension and forward motion through its dominant-key harmony. The opening melody then returns exactly as before, reaffirming the home key with the same poised character that began the movement.
