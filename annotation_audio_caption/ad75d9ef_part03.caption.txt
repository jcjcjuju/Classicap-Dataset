A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, stated in unison with a clear, stable sense of arrival, followed by a slightly extended phrase that reinforces this tonal center. A transitional passage unfolds over a sustained pedal tone, maintaining the home key while building momentum through harmonic tension, including a striking augmented sixth chord, before arriving at a half-cadence that creates anticipation. The lyrical second subject then appears, now transposed to the home key, beginning with a graceful four-bar phrase that ends inconclusively; this idea is restated with subtle alterations, followed by a rising sequential passage that builds intensity toward another half-cadence. The final portion of this section settles over a dominant pedal, leading into a contracted yet overlapping phrase that expands through repetition and cadential extension, culminating in a satisfying resolution within the home key.
