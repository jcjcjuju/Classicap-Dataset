A bold, contrapuntal theme returns in its original form and home key, now presented in octaves with fresh accompanying textures. This theme is soon followed by its answering voice, continuing the fugal dialogue. A final, clear statement of the same theme emerges, after which the music lingers on its closing gesture, elaborating the last few notes with increasing momentum. The section settles decisively into the home key, leading seamlessly into a coda that echoes fragments of the main theme over a sustained bass note, reinforcing a sense of grounded resolution.
