A bold, lyrical theme in G major unfolds in two balanced sections, establishing a stable, bright character. This theme returns immediately in a varied form, enriching its expression while retaining its essential shape. A transitional passage follows, built entirely from the opening motif of the theme, shifting through darker harmonic colors—first into E minor, then to D major, and finally arriving at A major with a growing sense of motion. A contrasting second theme emerges in D major, its harmony alternating simply between tonic and dominant, with the dominant chord subtly sustained in an inner voice, lending gentle tension beneath a clear melodic surface. Another transitional passage then guides the music back toward the home key, preparing for the return of the initial theme, now presented again in G major but without its earlier repetition, offering a more direct and focused restatement of the opening idea.
