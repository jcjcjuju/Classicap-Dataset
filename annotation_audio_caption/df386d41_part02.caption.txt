The music opens with a bold, angular theme derived from the movement’s opening idea, now reshaped and heard in a bright major key. This fragment soon returns in a darker, lower register, shifting to a somber minor mood. A single stark statement of the theme’s opening gesture follows in a distant, unexpected key, after which the texture becomes increasingly fragmented and exploratory. The music unfolds as a sequence of stark, triadic outlines—each one leaping through distant harmonic territories with a sense of searching urgency—before culminating in a dramatic, improvisatory flourish that hovers tensely above a dissonant chord, creating a moment of suspended anticipation.
