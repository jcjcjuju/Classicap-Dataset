A bold, energetic theme in D major returns, sounding stable and grounded as it unfolds in two balanced phrases. This is followed by a transitional passage that initially continues the opening material but soon shifts direction, steering the harmony toward a darker, more unsettled mood that settles briefly in E minor. Then, a contrasting lyrical idea emerges in that same somber key, gradually brightening as it journeys through related tonalities before arriving triumphantly in the home key of D major. The movement concludes with a final reflective section that echoes earlier motifs, now reshaped and firmly anchored in the warm, resolved sound of D major.
