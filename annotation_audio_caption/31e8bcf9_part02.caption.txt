A bold, energetic theme in E flat major unfolds in three overlapping sections: first heard in the upper voice, then restated in the lower voice with a new accompanying figure above, and finally continuing in the lower voice with a different upper accompaniment. This leads into a transitional passage featuring elaborate, flowing lines over a sustained E flat bass, followed by a shift toward a brighter tonal area. A four-bar phrase in G flat major is answered by a similar phrase in F major, then both are restated with added embellishments and variation. The music then settles into a lyrical second theme in B flat major, built from balanced four-bar phrases—each idea clearly presented and then transformed through repetition at different octaves or with inversion and subtle alteration—culminating in a brief closing passage that lingers on a harmonically expectant, dominant chord.
