The music begins with a gentle, flowing idea reminiscent of the second theme, supported by a subtly varied accompaniment that echoes the closing bars of the earlier codetta. Soon, a familiar melodic phrase—originally bold and grounded in the home key—returns transposed, now colored by the brighter tonality of F major. This gives way to restless triplet passages that flicker briefly through darker harmonic hues before settling decisively into the somber mood of G minor. Fleeting, rapid flourishes recall earlier ornamental figures, intertwined with fragmented echoes of the second theme. The harmony grows increasingly unsettled, shifting between G minor and C minor, then veering toward the warm, distant realm of E flat major before circling back to F major. This final arrival feels provisional, as the harmony immediately pivots away, setting up anticipation for a new tonal center.
