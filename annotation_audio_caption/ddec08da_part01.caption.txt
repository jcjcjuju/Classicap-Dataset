A bold, stable theme in B flat major unfolds in two clear sections, establishing a confident home base. This is followed by a transitional passage that begins with a brief, grounded phrase in the same key, then shifts color as it moves toward C major, sustained by a repeating bass note beneath a distinctive melodic figure. The music then settles into a contrasting theme in F major, offering a brighter, more lyrical quality while maintaining a sense of balance and clarity.
