A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, structured in two balanced phrases that each resolve with a sense of finality. This is followed by a lyrical transitional passage, now reshaped to remain within the home key rather than modulating outward. A contrasting second theme then unfolds, combining familiar motives from the opening theme into a new, unified idea, now also grounded in the stable tonality of the tonic. The section draws to a close with a brief codetta—a short, cadential phrase that gently reaffirms the home key before the music prepares to repeat.
