The music opens with a bold, energetic theme that firmly establishes a stable home base in D major, soon reinforced by a sustained bass note that creates a sense of tension as the harmony shifts toward A major. This tension resolves clearly into a strong, conclusive cadence in A, followed by a brief closing passage that reaffirms this new tonal center with descending melodic gestures. A contrasting section then begins, weaving through a series of shifting harmonic colors—briefly brightening into D and G major, then darkening through B minor and E minor—before settling into the somber mood of B minor, where another sustained bass note builds anticipation that finally resolves into a firm cadence in that key. From there, a sequence of descending phrases propels the music forward, culminating in an unresolved pause on the dominant chord of the original key. A swift, falling passage then lands decisively on the tonic D, ushering in a return of the opening theme, now transposed and briefly colored by G major before reasserting the home key. A final sustained bass note underpins a closing passage that echoes the earlier coda but now firmly rooted in D major, briefly glancing back at B minor and G major before closing with a strong, conclusive affirmation of the original key.
