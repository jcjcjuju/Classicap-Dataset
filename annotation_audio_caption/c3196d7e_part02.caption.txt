The music begins with a somber, unsettled mood in C minor, weaving together the opening motive of the first theme—characterized by its distinctive rhythmic shape—with flowing triplet figures borrowed from both the codetta and second subject. This material builds tension before arriving at a temporary resting point in G minor, only to immediately return in an inverted, overlapping form that shifts through keys and culminates in a questioning half-cadence in D minor. From there, a new passage emerges based on the lyrical opening of the second subject, now paired with a previously heard accompanying figure that dances above and below the main line, constantly flipping roles between treble and bass as the harmony cycles through D minor, G minor, C major, and F major in a fluid, sequential progression. The texture then tightens as both hands take up the same motive together: first with the bass echoing the treble at a half-bar delay and a fifth lower in B flat major, then shifting to F major with the imitation an octave apart. At the peak of this interplay, both parts move in opposite directions simultaneously, creating a striking mirror effect. The section closes with a familiar flourish—the closing gesture of the codetta—now colored by the rich, expectant tension of an F dominant seventh chord.
