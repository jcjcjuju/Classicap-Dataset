The music begins with a refined yet recognizable version of the opening two bars of the original Air, presented with near-original simplicity. Soon, the texture becomes more intricate as steady quarter-note lines transform into flowing eighth notes. A shift to a lilting 9/8 meter introduces triplet accompaniment figures, which quickly accelerate into sixteenth notes and then into rapid thirty-second notes as the meter returns to 3/4. At the midpoint, a fresh and contrasting variation emerges, unfolding over four bars before giving way to a dazzling passage built over a sustained dominant tone; this episode is later turned upside down, revealing the second half of the Air—now ornately varied—in the upper voice. The movement concludes with the full return of the original Air, stated plainly and without repetition, restoring its initial character in clear, unadorned form.
