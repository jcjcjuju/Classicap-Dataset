The music returns to the opening material: a bold theme unfolds first in A flat major, then shifts to D flat major, creating a sense of stable grounding followed by a bright, resonant contrast. This theme is then varied and restated with subtle alterations, maintaining its essential character while adding nuance. An interlude of contrasting musical ideas briefly intervenes before the opening theme reappears once more, now extended and enriched, yet still rooted in its original tonal centers, bringing a sense of familiar resolution.
