A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, its familiar shape now subtly reshaped—sometimes shifted to the lower register with altered accompaniment, sometimes presented with the melodic and harmonic roles of the voices swapped—yet retaining its essential character. This leads into a transitional passage that begins in a warmer, distant key before winding its way back to the stability of the tonic. The lyrical second theme then unfolds in this home key, its opening sequence cascading downward as before, but now expanded: midway through, a fragment of its own opening returns in a compressed form, immediately followed by a fuller restatement with the musical lines flipped and the bass deepened by octave doubling, creating a richer, more resonant texture. The movement closes with a strong, conclusive cadence, reinforced by two final emphatic chords.
