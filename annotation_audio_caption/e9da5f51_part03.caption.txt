A familiar theme returns, now adorned with embellishments that lend it a more ornate and expressive character, yet it unfolds with the same underlying structure as before. Instead of closing with a firm, stable chord in the home key, it pivots unexpectedly toward a series of unresolved, tense harmonies in A flat major, creating a sense of suspension that flows directly into a transitional passage. This passage weaves through shifting harmonic colors—from the warmth of A flat major to the darker hue of F minor—before finally settling into the reassuring stability of E flat major. There, a lyrical melody, previously heard in a brighter key, now resonates with a grounded, resolved quality, its contours mirrored in the lower voices as it unfolds with calm assurance.
