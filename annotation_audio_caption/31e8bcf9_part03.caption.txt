The music begins with fresh, unfamiliar material that unfolds with a sense of exploration. Midway through, a lyrical theme—previously heard as the second subject—emerges in a bright, unexpected key, first resonating in the lower register and then echoing in the higher range. This is followed by a brief allusion to the bold, energetic character of the first subject, which smoothly guides the music back toward its full return.
