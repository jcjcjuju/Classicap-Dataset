A lyrical subject unfolds in G major, establishing a stable, bright tonal center. This theme spans sixteen bars and concludes with a sense of gentle arrival on the chord of D, creating a feeling of partial resolution. The same thematic material then returns with subtle changes in its harmonic or melodic details, now extended slightly and culminating in a more pronounced sense of tension as it lands on the dominant seventh chord of D, heightening anticipation without immediate resolution.
