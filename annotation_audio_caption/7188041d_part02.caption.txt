A bright, lyrical theme unfolds in C major, carrying a sense of openness and warmth, before settling into the brighter, more expectant sound of G major. This theme is then heard again in full. Following this, a sustained G tone anchors a passage of harmonic tension and subtle motion, creating a hovering, unresolved atmosphere. The same lyrical theme returns, now restored to its original form and character. Finally, a brief transitional passage gently guides the harmony away from this territory, shifting colors as it moves toward the darker, grounded stability of E minor.
