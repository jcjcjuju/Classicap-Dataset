The music returns to the bold, energetic character of the opening Scherzo, presenting its lively theme in C major with a clear sense of rhythmic drive and stability. This is followed by a concluding passage that introduces a distinctive figure first heard earlier in the movement, now developed into a final, emphatic coda that reinforces the home key with decisive closure.
