The music returns to the home key with a bold, energetic theme, now presented with its original bass line transformed and heard in the higher register, creating a sense of intricate interplay between voices. This initial thematic material appears without its more harmonically restless continuation, leading directly into a transitional passage that revisits earlier motivic content, now beginning in a brighter major key before steering back toward the home tonality. A lyrical, sequential theme follows, now firmly rooted in the stable home key rather than a distant one, giving it a resolved and grounded character compared to its earlier appearance. The movement concludes with a strong, final cadence, then unfolds a closing passage where upper and lower lines move in opposite directions, echoing earlier bass gestures in a clear, reflective gesture that brings the piece to a decisive close.
