A bold theme marked by striking octave leaps unfolds in the alto, followed by a brief closing phrase in a somber key. This theme is then answered in a higher voice, now colored by a new tonal center that creates a sense of gentle tension. A short connecting passage shifts the harmony back before the theme reappears in the lowest voice, grounded and resonant. A flowing interlude follows, weaving through changing harmonies until the answer returns in the middle voice, now accompanied for the first time by a complementary line in the bass that descends with rhythmic urgency. The music then journeys through a series of episodes and thematic statements, each in a new key: the theme soars in the top voice with its counterpoint beneath, then resounds in the bass while the upper voice responds; another episode leads to the answer again in the alto, paired with the counterpoint above. After a longer transitional passage that gradually returns to the home key, the theme is heard alone in the alto, unaccompanied by its usual counterpart. Immediately, the bass enters with the same theme while the alto is still sounding it, creating a tight overlap that feels urgent yet incomplete. A final brief episode settles the harmony back home, setting the stage for the theme to return clearly in the treble, unadorned at first, then later echoed in the alto and bass in close succession, with the top voice finally embellishing the theme with quick passing notes as the piece draws to a close.
