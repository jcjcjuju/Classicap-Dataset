The music begins with a slightly altered version of the passage that closed the exposition, now sounding in the distant, richly colored key of G flat major. Soon, the more lyrical and expansive second part of the opening theme emerges in this same key. A new, distinct musical idea then appears, marked by a sudden shift to the tense, dark hue of B minor, reached through a subtle enharmonic pivot. This new figure is heard again, now cast in the somber tones of C minor, then reappears successively in the warmer glow of A flat major and the resonant depth of D flat major. From D flat, the harmony pivots smoothly to C major, where the same figure is restated with bright clarity. The lyrical second part of the opening theme returns once more, now grounded in C major. The music then moves through a series of shifting harmonic landscapes before finally settling on a sustained, expectant dominant harmony that creates a strong sense of anticipation.
