A bold, stable theme in D major unfolds over a sustained low D, its opening four-bar phrase immediately echoed with subtle variation, followed by another four-bar idea that is likewise restated with gentle alteration. This is succeeded by a flowing passage of arpeggios that begins firmly in D major but gradually shifts harmonic ground, arriving at a bright E major. A new lyrical subject then emerges in A major, introduced by the upper voice and promptly imitated a ninth lower by the middle voice, then again by the bass; this four-bar melody returns with nuanced changes, and its closing gesture is extended through immediate repetition. A brief transitional passage follows, building momentum toward the return of the initial theme in its original key, now subtly enriched by a delicate ornamental figure in the upper part where silence had previously rested.
