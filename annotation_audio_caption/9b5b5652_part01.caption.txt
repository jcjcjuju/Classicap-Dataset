A bold, distinctive theme in A major is introduced in the highest voice, immediately answered by a version transposed to E major in the middle voice, creating a sense of harmonic tension and forward motion. The theme returns in the lowest voice in A major, followed shortly by its transposed form in the same low register, now in E major. A brief closing passage reaffirms A major before the theme reappears once more in the high voice. This leads into a transitional passage that shifts the music toward F sharp minor, where the theme emerges again in the bass. After a brief gap, it returns in the bass in E major, followed by an extended episode that weaves through A and E major before settling back into A. Here, the theme sounds again in the bass, now accompanied by a newly introduced, quicker-moving line in the alto. The transposed version of the theme follows in the alto, first in A major, then in E major. A new transitional passage carries the harmony from E through A to D major, where the theme is heard in the alto and firmly closes in D. It then appears in the bass with chromatic alterations, establishing B minor, and another episode unfolds, moving from B minor to F sharp minor. In that key, a modified form of the transposed theme sounds in the bass and concludes the section. The original theme returns in the alto in A major, followed by a modified transposed version in the bass in E major. The movement ends with a coda built from frequent, overlapping echoes of the main theme.
