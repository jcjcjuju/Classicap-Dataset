The music opens with a series of starkly contrasting fragments. It begins slowly and solemnly in a bright key, then shifts abruptly to a more animated passage centered on a different tonal center. This is followed by a swift, intense section in a darker, minor key, which in turn gives way to a brighter, transitional idea that pivots unexpectedly toward a new tonal goal. Throughout, fleeting echoes of the opening fragment reappear between these contrasting sections, creating a sense of unstable, searching momentum that flows directly into the main theme without pause.
