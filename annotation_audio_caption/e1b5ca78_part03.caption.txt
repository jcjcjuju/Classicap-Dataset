A bold, energetic theme in A flat major returns, establishing a stable home base, followed by a modulating passage that creates a sense of transition. This material is then heard again, with the main theme now subtly altered in its details while retaining its essential character. A contrasting lyrical idea enters unexpectedly in G flat major, introducing a striking harmonic shift before gradually resolving back to the comforting stability of A flat major. The movement concludes with an extended closing section that lingers on familiar harmonies, reinforcing the sense of return and finality.
