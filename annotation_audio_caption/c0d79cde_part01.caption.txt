A bold, angular subject in F minor is introduced in the treble, followed by a tonal answer in the alto that shifts the music toward C minor, creating a sense of harmonic tension without a consistent counter-melody. A brief codetta then guides the harmony back to F minor, where the subject reappears firmly in the bass. The music soon enters a series of developmental episodes: the first weaves fragments of the subject’s second half into a modulating passage that brightens into A flat major, where the subject returns in the treble. This is answered in the alto in E flat major before another episode—similar in construction but redistributed among the voices—steers the harmony through distant keys back to F minor. The subject emerges again in the bass, only to be swept into a third episode featuring a persistent dominant pedal and flowing counterpoint above, leading to another statement of the subject in the alto. A final, extended episode unfolds with the bass now drawing on the subject’s opening motif, while new, independent lines unfold in the upper voices, gradually shifting the tonality toward B flat minor. There, the subject sounds once more in the treble, before returning in the alto to F minor, where it anchors a closing passage that settles the music into a stable, conclusive coda.
