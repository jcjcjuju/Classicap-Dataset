A gentle, lullaby-like theme unfolds in the warm key of B major, evoking the character of a Polish Christmas carol. The melody is largely diatonic, flowing smoothly with only a fleeting shift to F sharp major and a single expressive chromatic passing note. It concludes with a clear, resolved cadence in B major, enriched by a tender added sixth in the harmony. This calm atmosphere gives way to a more restless passage that sequences through harmonies, drifting from B major toward the darker hue of G sharp minor, marked by a tense diminished seventh chord and an unresolved cadence. The music then oscillates between related chords in G sharp minor before finding its way back to the reassuring stability of B major. The lullaby theme returns, unchanged at first, then subtly varied in its ornamentation on its next appearance. In its final iteration, the theme remains serene until the closing bars, where a sustained dominant note in the bass introduces growing harmonic tension—first through a dissonant diminished seventh, then a striking German augmented sixth chord that pulls the music unexpectedly into the somber realm of F sharp minor. The section ends with a sudden contrast: two powerful, arresting chords echo the movement’s opening, while faint, fading echoes of the lullaby dissolve into silence.
