A new, lyrical melody unfolds in the bright key of A major, soon shifting toward the dominant E major with a sense of gentle forward motion. This gives way to a passage that moves through changing harmonies in a stepwise, sequential pattern, briefly touching B minor before settling back into A major. The music then returns—not to the opening melody itself, but to a familiar shape reminiscent of an earlier phrase—now reshaped to conclude firmly and warmly in the home key, anchored by a sustained bass note that evokes the stability of the movement’s beginning. Throughout, echoes of earlier material subtly color the new ideas, blending freshness with a sense of return.
