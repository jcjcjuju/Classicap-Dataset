A new melody begins in a warm, relaxed key a fourth below the home tonality, unfolding with a gentle character before shifting direction through subtle harmonic turns. This section concludes with an unexpected, inverted cadence that lands softly in a brighter, related key. The music then restarts with the same opening idea, now transposed to a distant, luminous major key, but quickly embarks on a winding, stepwise journey through a series of increasingly shadowed minor keys—each phrase echoing the last while descending into darker harmonic colors—until it pauses expectantly on an unresolved half-cadence. From there, two transitional bars deftly guide the harmony back toward the original, stable home key, setting the stage for the return of the main theme.
