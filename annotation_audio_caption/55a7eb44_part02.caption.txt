A new theme begins in a somber, minor mood, unfolding in C minor with a sense of brooding intensity. This material is then repeated, after which the music shifts to G minor, introducing a contrasting shade of melancholy. The harmonic landscape continues to evolve, moving through F minor before finally arriving at a brighter, more stable E flat major. This transition is followed by a brief passage that echoes an earlier moment of harmonic preparation, creating a subtle sense of return without reiterating previous thematic content.
