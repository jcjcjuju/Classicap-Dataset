The music begins with a brief echo of the final three notes from the previous section, then unfolds with a clear reference to the opening phrase of the main theme—initially heard as a bold, energetic idea that quickly shifts through keys. Around midway, a new, winding chromatic passage emerges, creating a sense of searching tension before giving way to a developed version of the second phrase of the main theme—this time more expansive and harmonically restless. The entire section gradually settles back into the home key, arriving with a feeling of stability and resolution.
