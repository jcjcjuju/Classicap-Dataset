The music opens with a tense, unresolved chord that repeats insistently, creating a sense of suspense before cascading downward in a scale that finally settles into a stable, somber home key. A bold, lyrical theme emerges in this key, unfolding in two distinct spans: the first is restated shortly after with a changed bass line, while the second returns with subtle variation, both firmly rooted in the same tonal center. Fragments of this theme then reappear in a transitional passage, first anchored by the home chord, then shifting toward a new tonal area with growing harmonic pull. A contrasting theme follows in a darker, related key, ending inconclusively before returning with variation to close decisively. This is followed by a brief concluding section built from echoes of the opening theme, alternating between two harmonies that reinforce the new key, before a short, anticipatory passage leads away toward further development.
