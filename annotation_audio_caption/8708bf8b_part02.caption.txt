A bold, energetic theme in D flat major is heard, establishing a stable home base. This is followed by a contrasting episode that introduces new musical ideas, creating a sense of departure. The section then closes with a subtle echo of the opening theme, returning to the original key but without a full or direct restatement, offering a faint reminiscence rather than a clear return.
