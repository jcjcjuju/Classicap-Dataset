A bold, balanced theme begins in B flat major, establishing a stable home base before shifting toward a brighter, more expectant tonal area. The opening idea concludes with a gentle, unresolved cadence, then repeats and expands, building momentum until it lands firmly in a new key with a strong, conclusive cadence. A brief, wandering passage follows, colored by chromatic inflections, which gradually guides the music back toward the original key, arriving at a moment of poised anticipation. The initial theme then returns, now subtly transformed—its melody inverted—yet retaining its essential character, and this time it unfolds entirely within the home key, extending slightly before closing with a satisfying sense of finality.
