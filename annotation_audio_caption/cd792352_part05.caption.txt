The original melody returns in its clear, balanced form, presented without repetition. It unfolds in two symmetrical phrases that lead toward a resolution, but instead of closing with a stable, final chord, the music is unexpectedly interrupted by a tense, dissonant sonority—a minor ninth chord in its third inversion. This unsettling harmony lingers, repeating to create a sense of suspended closure, as if holding its breath before the next movement begins.
