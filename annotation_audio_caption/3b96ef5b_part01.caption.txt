The music begins with a stable, grounded theme in the home key, soon introducing a sense of tension as it moves through a sharp-edged harmonic area before settling into a clear, resolved cadence in a darker, related minor key. It then shifts gently into still more somber minor territories, exploring distant harmonic colors before finding its way back to the original tonal center. A sustained, expectant harmony then emerges, holding firmly in place to reaffirm the home key, leading to a brief closing passage that brings the movement to a quiet, conclusive rest.
