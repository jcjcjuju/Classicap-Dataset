A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, sounding stable and complete with its balanced phrases ending first in suspense and then with resolution. This leads into a transitional passage that begins familiarly but soon shifts color, moving through warmer, more distant harmonies—first to a bright but unexpected major key, then into a darker minor—before finally settling back into the home tonality. A lyrical second theme follows, now grounded in the home key yet subtly reshaped; it briefly wanders into a gentler major key for its repeated opening idea before circling back to the central tonality, where its closing gestures echo earlier cadences with slight variation. The section draws to a quiet, conclusive close with a brief codetta that reaffirms the home key.
