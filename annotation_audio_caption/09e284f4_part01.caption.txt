A bold, restless theme in B flat minor opens the movement, soon shifting to the warmer, more luminous D flat major before snapping back abruptly to the minor mode, closing with a sense of unresolved tension. The same opening theme returns, again in B flat minor, but now veers toward the darker F minor instead of the earlier major key. A contrasting lyrical theme follows in D flat major, colored by a haunting flattened sixth that adds a touch of chromatic unease. An expressive, animated melody then unfolds in G flat major, flowing through related keys with ornamental dissonances—suspensions and appoggiaturas—that heighten its emotional intensity, while recurring diminished seventh chords inject moments of instability. This section builds over a sustained dominant pedal, culminating in a strong, conclusive cadence in D flat major, followed by a closing passage of clear, arpeggiated harmonies that affirm the key. The entire sequence then returns with subtle rhythmic alterations to the initial theme, preserving its character while refreshing its delivery.
