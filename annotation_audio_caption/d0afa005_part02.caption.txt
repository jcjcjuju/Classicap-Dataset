A bold theme in C minor opens with a steady, grounding bass note that persists beneath the first four bars, creating a sense of stability. This theme concludes rhythmically soon after, only to be immediately echoed and extended toward a point of tension. A series of passages follows, each derived from the opening idea but shifting through different tonal centers—G, A-flat, and B-flat—while building anticipation through repeated cadential gestures stretched out in time. This leads into a contrasting second theme that begins with a darker, more somber quality in E-flat minor, then gradually brightens as it unfolds in E-flat major across two expansive sections. The entire exposition closes with a brief return of the initial theme, now transformed into the warmer hue of E-flat major, before ending on a harmonically unsettled chord that hints at G minor.
