A bold theme in E minor unfolds with a grounded, stable character, followed by a section that explores more restless and varied harmonic terrain. The opening theme then returns clearly in its original key, reestablishing its initial mood. The music concludes with a bright shift to E major, where a short, distinctive fragment from the main theme is repeated five times over a sustained low E, creating a resonant, anchored close.
