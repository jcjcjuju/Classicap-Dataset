The music opens with a somber, harmonically unsettled passage in G minor, beginning with a widely spaced arpeggio outlining a rich, foreign-sounding chord—C, E-flat, and A-flat—played in unison octaves by both hands. A descending neighbor note, B-flat, adds a subtle melodic inflection that hints at a motif to return later. The harmony avoids a clear G minor triad, creating a sense of searching or instability. In the final moments, the texture thickens into block chords that shift through darker, introspective harmonies, culminating in a chord that places the dominant note, D, in the bass—setting up a strong pull toward the next section without resolving it yet.
