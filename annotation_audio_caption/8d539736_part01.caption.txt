The music begins with a steady, grounding bass note that anchors the opening passage, over which a distinctive melodic figure unfolds in the upper voice. This figure is soon heard again in a descending sequence, creating a sense of flowing motion. The harmony gradually shifts away from the home key, passing through darker, more remote tonal areas—first a somber E-flat minor, then the warmer but still distant A-flat major, followed by the even more remote D-flat major—before finding its way back to a stable tonal center. The section culminates in a strong, conclusive cadence in F minor, lending a feeling of arrival. A new bass line then emerges, also moving in a descending sequence, while the original opening figure continues above, now interacting with this new motion. The harmony builds tension with a sustained dominant pedal, which finally resolves into a return of the grounding tonic pedal, bringing a sense of closure.
