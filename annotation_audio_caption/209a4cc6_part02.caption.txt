A lyrical theme, now in D flat major, unfolds with a gentle character before settling into A flat major. This is followed by a sequential episode that echoes the rhythmic shape of the theme, developing it through a series of stepwise repetitions. After this passage concludes, it is immediately played again from its beginning. The section then closes with a brief, harmonically restless transition that shifts keys to prepare for the return of the main theme.
