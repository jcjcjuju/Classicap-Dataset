A bold, energetic theme opens the section, establishing a clear sense of home before moving toward a strong point of arrival in a brighter, closely related key. This is followed by a varied version of the opening idea, now colored by a new harmonic perspective, leading to a moment of poised anticipation in the original key. A contrasting theme then emerges with lyrical clarity in the upper voice, soon echoed in the lower register, and the music settles into a darker, more introspective mood through a conclusive cadence in a minor key. The sound then brightens again as the harmony turns back toward the central tonal center, arriving at a firm cadence that reaffirms the home key. The opening theme returns, subtly embellished, and is soon joined by a freely adapted version of an earlier figure in the bass, enriching the texture before culminating in a decisive, stable close in the home key. The final bars reinforce this tonal center with added harmonic fullness, bringing the music to a resolute and satisfying end.
