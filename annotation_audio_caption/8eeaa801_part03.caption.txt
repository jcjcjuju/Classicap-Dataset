A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, unfolding for eight bars with its original character before shifting into a layered texture where the main figure sounds simultaneously in its original and inverted forms across different voices, creating a tightly woven, imitative dialogue. This leads into a transitional passage that echoes earlier material but with fresh harmonic color. The music then moves through a connecting episode whose opening gestures recall the earlier transition but with subtle melodic and harmonic adjustments, followed by a second segment that mirrors its predecessor exactly, now lifted higher in pitch and resolving securely into the tonic key. A lyrical second theme follows, now grounded in the stable home tonality with slight ornamental changes. The movement concludes with a coda that draws on earlier ideas: first stretching out a familiar gesture, then recalling the opening theme, and later reintroducing a flowing, contrasting phrase from the first subject that had been left out earlier. The final moments settle into a sustained, resonant tone in the bass, anchoring the music in a calm, conclusive stability.
