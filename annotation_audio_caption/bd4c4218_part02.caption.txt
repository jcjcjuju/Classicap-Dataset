The music begins with a transformed version of the bold, rhythmic first theme, now reshaped into a three-bar pattern that creates a subtly unsettled flow compared to its original two-bar symmetry. Fragments of both the energetic first subject and the lyrical second subject intertwine and evolve, shifting through different harmonic landscapes. This sense of exploration and instability builds until a sustained, unchanging bass note anchors the texture for an extended passage, creating mounting tension that gradually resolves into a return of familiar material.
