A bold, energetic theme in the home key returns clearly, followed by a transitional passage that subtly reshapes its earlier form to prepare for the arrival of the second theme now firmly grounded in the tonic key. This second theme unfolds with lyrical grace, presenting a balanced, structured melody that concludes with a strong sense of resolution. A brief connecting passage then leads back to the return of the opening theme, which reappears with its original character intact. It is followed by supplementary material that extends and supports the theme’s closing gesture, before the music settles into a short coda that echoes the opening of the transition, repeating its cadential motion to bring the movement to a quiet, conclusive close.
