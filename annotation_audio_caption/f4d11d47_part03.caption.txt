A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, unfolding with the same confident shape as before, ending with a clear, resolved cadence. This is followed by a transitional passage that begins as it did earlier but now extends further, spinning out a new sequence that stretches the music before reshaping its path to prepare for the next theme. A lyrical, flowing melody then appears, now firmly grounded in the home key instead of the brighter dominant, its phrases gently varied and expanded as they reach toward closure. The section draws to a close with a brief codetta, echoing the opening theme’s initial gesture and embellished with quick, decorative flourishes, all slightly extended to reinforce the sense of return and resolution.
