A fugal section unfolds with a subject derived from the movement’s opening theme, now cast in a darker, unsettled mood in A minor. This subject is answered in a new voice, accompanied by a distinct counter-melody, and soon returns again, its final gesture echoed closely below by an inner voice. The subject reappears twice more, the second time giving way to a striking moment of stark harmonic motion—consecutive fifths—that momentarily disrupts the texture. Fragments of the subject then fuel a transitional passage, followed by another built from its very first motif. The subject resurfaces once more, now in the brighter but still unstable key of C major. After an extended interlude of developmental material, the voices begin to overlap in tight succession, accelerating into a dense stretto. The fugue concludes with a layered, imitative statement of the subject, then settles onto a sustained dominant harmony, over which rippling arpeggios prolong the tension before resolving into the return of the main theme.
