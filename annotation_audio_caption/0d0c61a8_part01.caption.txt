A bold, angular theme emerges in the bass, establishing a somber mood in C sharp minor, soon answered by a higher voice in G sharp minor that mirrors its shape but shifts the tonal center. The theme returns in the alto, reaffirming the home key, followed by a brief closing gesture. Another answer enters in a high voice, now veering toward F sharp minor, before the theme resurfaces in the top voice, firmly back in C sharp minor, and is capped by a short cadential phrase. The answer reappears in the tenor in G sharp minor, then the subject follows in the tenor in F sharp minor, and finally the answer sounds in the alto, returning to C sharp minor. The music then shifts through distant keys: an answer in the bass lands in B major, followed by the subject in E major, introducing a new, contrasting melody in the top voice—the first of two counter-melodies that will intertwine with the main theme. This new line weaves above and below subsequent entries of the subject and its answer as the harmony moves through G sharp minor, F sharp minor, A major, D sharp minor, and back to C sharp minor. Episodes unfold with rising sequences and inverted forms of the counter-melody, while the second counter-melody gradually takes prominence, eventually dominating the texture. Later, the subject and answer return in close succession across multiple voices in a tightly woven stretto, all underpinned by a sustained dominant tone. The music settles into a final passage where the subject appears once more in the highest voice, accompanied by the second counter-melody in rich harmonies, culminating in a serene coda over a steady pedal on the home note. The final chords unexpectedly brighten into a major key, ending with a gentle, resolved consonance.
