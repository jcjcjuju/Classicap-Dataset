A bold, energetic theme in the home key opens the section, presenting only its initial eight-bar idea without continuation. This gives way to a newly invented transitional passage that begins like a natural extension of the theme but soon diverges, introducing imitative counterpoint where the bass echoes the treble at a wide interval and a full bar’s delay. The music then folds in on itself through an overlapping inversion of this new material, truncating its final gesture to launch a tightly woven sequence of overlapping imitations. These fragments climb upward in pitch, shifting through a series of keys—G major, A minor, B minor—before settling firmly back into the home key. What follows is an unusual reordering: the lyrical, phrase-irregular melody from the second subject’s latter portion appears first, now expanded and recast in the tonic, followed by the return of its opening motive, also transposed to the home key and reshaped. The section closes with a brief, slightly altered version of the earlier codetta, reaffirming the stability of the tonic.
