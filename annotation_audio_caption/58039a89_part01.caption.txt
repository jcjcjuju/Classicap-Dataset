A bold, energetic theme built from a distinctive three-bar figure unfolds in the home key of F major, soon moving through a bright C major and a fleeting touch of G minor before settling back into F. This opening section concludes with a strong, resolved cadence in C major, creating a sense of arrival away from the tonic. The music then continues in that C major space, briefly visiting D minor and brushing against both C and F major again, only to end with an unresolved, expectant pause in D minor. From there, a passage rooted in D minor journeys back toward C major, momentarily resting in F along the way, and closes once more with a firm, conclusive cadence in C. A brief, transitional phrase then shifts the harmony smoothly from C major to A minor, setting up a new section that briefly hints at D minor before landing decisively in A minor with a clear, final cadence. Finally, the music returns to the original F major, reintroducing the main theme exactly as it first appeared, later touching on the warmer, richer color of B-flat major before drawing the entire prelude to a satisfying close with a strong, stable cadence in the home key of F.
