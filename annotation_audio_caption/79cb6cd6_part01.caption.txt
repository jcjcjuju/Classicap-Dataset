A bold, angular theme emerges in the alto voice in a somber B flat minor, soon answered by a higher treble voice stating the same material transposed to F minor, while the alto weaves a complementary counter-melody beneath. A brief closing gesture follows, leading to the theme’s return in the bass, again in B flat minor, with the alto continuing its counterpoint. Another short cadential passage precedes the answer appearing in the tenor, now in F minor, supported by a new counter-subject in the bass. The music then shifts through a transitional passage that moves from F minor toward D flat major before settling back into B flat minor. The subject reappears in the tenor, immediately overlapped by its answer in the alto—creating a tightly woven, imitative dialogue in the home key. A brief link ushers in the subject again, now in the bright key of D flat major in the treble, instantly answered by the bass in a close imitation. This gives way to another modulating interlude that journeys back toward B flat minor. The character of the theme then transforms as it is heard upside-down: first the inverted answer enters in the tenor with an inverted counter-subject above in the alto, both in B flat minor; next, the inverted subject appears in the alto in E flat minor, paired with an inverted counter-subject in the tenor. After a short cadence, the inverted subject sounds in the treble with its inverted counterpart in the alto, returning to B flat minor, followed by another brief cadential pause. The inversion continues as the answer appears in the bass in A flat minor, accompanied by the second half of the inverted counter-subject in the treble. A further episode modulates from A flat minor through E flat minor back to B flat minor, setting up the inverted subject in the tenor, immediately overlapped by its inverted answer in the treble. Another cadence leads to the inverted subject in the alto in F minor, instantly mirrored by its inverted answer in the bass. A final short link precedes the subject’s appearance in the treble in A flat major, now in inversion, with the tenor providing a non-inverted answer in close imitation. A last transitional passage winds through E flat minor before returning to B flat minor, where the subject enters powerfully in the bass, simultaneously met by its inverted answer in the alto. A brief cadence clears the way for
