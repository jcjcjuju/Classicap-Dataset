A bold, angular subject in G sharp minor opens in the highest voice, soon answered in the middle voice by a closely related version in D sharp minor, accompanied by a flowing counter-melody above. A brief transitional passage weaves through shifting harmonies before the subject reappears in the lowest voice, now unaccompanied by its usual counterpoint. Another short transition leads to the subject sounding in the middle voice, this time with the counter-melody below it in the bass. A longer episode follows, developing fragments of earlier material while moving toward D sharp minor, where the answer enters in the bass without its counterpart. Two more episodes unfold—one passing through B major and another returning to D sharp minor—each time the answer appears alone, first in the treble then absent of counter-subject. A third episode guides the music back to G sharp minor, setting up a full statement of the subject in the bass paired with a slightly varied counter-melody in the alto. A brief cadential passage shifts to D sharp major, followed by a lone presentation of the counter-subject in the treble, then another cadence returns to G sharp minor where the counter-subject appears again, now in the alto without the subject. The music ventures into C sharp minor with the counter-subject in the bass, then cycles back to G sharp minor through another cadence, after which the counter-subject sounds once more in the treble. An extended episode explores G sharp and D sharp minor before the subject returns firmly in the bass with its counter-melody in the alto. A short transition moves to D sharp minor for an answer in the treble accompanied by the counter-subject, then another cadence drifts through G sharp minor to C sharp minor. The subject emerges in E major in the alto with the counter-melody above, followed by a final episode that winds back to G sharp minor. In the closing section, the subject is heard in the alto with the counter-subject beneath, then after a final modulating episode, it appears one last time in the treble with the counter-melody in the alto, leading into a conclusive coda.
