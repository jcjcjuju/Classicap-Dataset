The music begins with flowing triplet rhythms reminiscent of the earlier transition, now paired with a new melodic idea in the upper voice that undergoes brief elaboration. A sequential passage follows, built from the opening gesture of the second subject, shifting through a series of harmonic centers—D minor, G minor, then C major—before momentarily settling into F major. The harmony then circles back to D minor before finally anchoring in the home key of F major at the very end. A smoothly slurred two-beat figure appears, derived from earlier semiquaver material, and a subtle harmonic shift occurs through an enharmonic reinterpretation, transforming a dissonant chord in D minor into an equivalent sonority that leads decisively back to F major. Near the close, a fleeting reference to a small motive from the first subject emerges, offering a momentary echo of the movement’s opening idea.
