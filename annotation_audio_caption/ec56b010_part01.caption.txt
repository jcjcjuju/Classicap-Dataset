A somber theme in F minor begins in the tenor voice, soon answered in the alto with a tonally adjusted version that shifts toward C minor, accompanied by a flowing counter-melody in the tenor. This is followed by another layer: a new counter-melody appears in the tenor while the original theme enters in the bass, now back in F minor, with the first counter-melody sounding in the alto. A brief closing passage derived from that same counter-melody leads into a third statement of the main theme, this time in the treble, supported by both counter-melodies in the lower voices. A transitional passage then unfolds, built from inverted fragments of the first counter-melody, steering the music toward C minor. The theme returns in the tenor, now paired with both counter-melodies redistributed among the upper voices. Another transition follows, echoing the previous one but reshaped in the inner voice, guiding the harmony back to F minor. The theme reappears in the bass, again with both counter-melodies present in the upper parts. A more animated transitional section introduces a new lively figure in the treble while drawing from earlier material, shifting the tonality to A flat major, where the theme sounds in the alto with its first counter-melody above and only a hint of the second below. A further transition, constructed from the first counter-melody in the upper voices over a running bass line, moves the music to E flat major, where a true transposed answer appears in the tenor, now mostly unaccompanied except for fleeting echoes of earlier motives. An expansive transition involving all four voices then modulates to C minor, setting up the theme’s return in the treble with both counter-melodies fully restored. A final transition, recalling the earliest transitional material, brings the harmony back to F minor. The theme enters once more in the bass, now joined only by the first counter-melody in the treble, as the second is omitted. The movement closes with a brief coda that ends not in the expected minor, but with a bright major chord.
