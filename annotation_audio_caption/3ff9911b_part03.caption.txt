A bold, stable theme returns in the home key, sounding exactly as it did at the opening. This is followed by a brief transitional passage that shifts through distant harmonic colors—first touching a somber D minor, then briefly brightening through E major before settling into the home minor key. A familiar melody, now reshaped and heard in the home key, unfolds next; though derived from earlier material through inversion, its contour and character remain recognizable, with subtle alterations in its latter half. The movement concludes with a coda that draws exclusively on earlier non-thematic material from the exposition, weaving fragments into a final, reflective close.
