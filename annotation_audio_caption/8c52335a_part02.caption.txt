A new theme in C major begins with a balanced, eight-bar phrase that concludes with a strong sense of resolution in that key, and this entire phrase is immediately heard again. Following this repetition, the music shifts into a passage organized in four-bar units, sustained by a persistent dominant pedal point of C major, which gradually steers the harmony toward G major. This leads into a return of the opening phrase of the first subject, now adapted to this transitional context. The section closes with a brief codetta, where the final two bars are played three times in succession for emphasis. This is followed by a fourteen-bar passage derived from the first subject, unfolding with a sense of building anticipation as it moves toward a dominant harmony, setting up the next full return of the first subject.
