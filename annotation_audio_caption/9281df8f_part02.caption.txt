The music begins with a fragment reminiscent of the opening theme, now reshaped from its original bass line into a new melodic idea that unfolds over a sustained harmonic foundation. This idea is then heard again at different pitch levels, layered above a persistent pedal tone, creating a sense of searching intensity. The tension gradually gives way as the harmony settles into the warm, stable sound of C major. Within this new key, a fresh episode emerges, gently steering the music back toward the home key of E minor through subtle harmonic shifts. The entire section concludes with a strong, expectant chord that points clearly toward B minor, leaving a feeling of unresolved anticipation.
