A bold, energetic theme in C minor returns, now more concise, followed by a connecting passage whose lyrical phrase is heard three times—first in G flat major, then again in G flat major, and finally in E flat minor, all underpinned by a sustained bass note on C. A gentler, songlike theme appears in F major, but soon reemerges fully in the home key of C minor, restoring its stable, grounded quality. The movement concludes with a coda derived from earlier closing material, now reshaped and firmly anchored in C minor.
