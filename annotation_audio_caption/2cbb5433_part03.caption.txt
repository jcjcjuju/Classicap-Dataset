A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, now enriched with variation and including a previously omitted repeated section. This is followed by an extended transitional passage that develops motifs from earlier, ultimately settling into a bright D major. A lyrical second theme then unfolds in the stable, resonant home key, supported by clear harmonic grounding. Another transitional passage begins similarly to its earlier counterpart but is now expanded and transposed, building expectation before dissolving into a closing section. This coda opens with a sustained harmonic tension beneath interwoven melodic fragments recalling the theme’s second part; in its final moments, the music echoes the main theme multiple times, offering a reflective, fragmented farewell instead of a full restatement.
