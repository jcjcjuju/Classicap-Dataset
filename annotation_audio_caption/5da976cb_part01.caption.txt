The music opens with a bold, somber theme in C sharp minor, unfolding through flowing arpeggios that span two bars at first, then quicken into a one-bar rhythm. This gives way to a sustained sense of tension as a dominant pedal point anchors the harmony, creating a restless yet grounded close to the opening idea. A brief transitional passage follows, echoing the arpeggiated character of the initial theme while shifting the tonal center from C sharp minor toward G sharp minor. There, a new theme emerges—lyrical yet shadowed—remaining firmly in G sharp minor across two distinct spans, each beginning and ending with the same tonal stability. The second of these spans further divides into contrasting gestures: a more expansive phrase followed by a tighter, conclusive one. The section then pivots smoothly through a brief modulation that prepares either a return to the opening material or a shift into C sharp major for what follows.
