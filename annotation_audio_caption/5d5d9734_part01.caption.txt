The music begins with a series of short, clear phrases over a sustained bass, creating a stable yet expectant atmosphere. A persistent low note anchors the harmony, first building tension that resolves gently into the warm, settled sound of A flat major, marked by a strong, conclusive cadence. This calm is soon left behind as the music drifts through a succession of keys—first to the bright openness of E flat, then into the somber hues of B flat minor, briefly touching the rich, distant color of D flat major. A momentary pause on the dominant chord creates anticipation before a flowing sequence guides the harmony back toward the home key of F, culminating in a firm, satisfying resolution. The final bars reinforce this tonal center with quiet certainty, bringing the movement to a grounded close.
