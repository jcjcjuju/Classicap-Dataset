The music begins in a darker, unsettled mood with a shift to G minor, weaving fragments of the bold, rhythmic first theme and the lyrical second theme into a restless exploration. These familiar ideas are transformed and passed through changing harmonies, creating a sense of searching and tension. This builds steadily until the harmony locks onto a sustained dominant note, over which the music intensifies for an extended stretch, culminating in a strong, expectant dominant seventh chord that hangs unresolved.
