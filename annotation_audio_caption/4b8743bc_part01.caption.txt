A steady low note anchors the harmony while a rapid, repeating pattern dances above it, creating a shimmering tension. This texture shifts as the repeating figure moves to a middle voice, now supported by a new sustained note that introduces a subtle harmonic pull. The music builds toward a clear and resolved arrival in a brighter, related key, marked by a strong cadence. After a pause, the pattern returns with the rapid motion now nestled in a lower inner voice over a deep sustained tone, soon giving way to a return of the original anchoring note in the bass. The passage ultimately settles with a firm, conclusive cadence back in the home key, bringing a sense of grounded resolution.
