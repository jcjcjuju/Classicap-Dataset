A bold, energetic theme—now shadowed in a darker, minor mode—begins low in the bass, immediately establishing a sense of tension and instability. This idea, familiar yet transformed, is soon passed between voices in tight, overlapping imitation, creating a dense, interwoven texture that continuously develops the same core material. Throughout, the music remains rooted in the character of the original theme, but its repetition and contrapuntal treatment generate a feeling of restless exploration and harmonic uncertainty.
