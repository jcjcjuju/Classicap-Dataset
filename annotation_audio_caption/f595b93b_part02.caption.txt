A sudden, stormy outburst erupts with driving sixteenth-note motion, loud dynamics, and dramatic swells. A brusque, ascending left-hand motif in A minor clashes with right-hand accents, creating turbulent cross-rhythms. The harmony shifts between stark tonic chords—briefly colored by an added sixth that momentarily suggests F major before collapsing into minor—and tense diminished seventh chords. This theme soon reappears transposed down to G minor, then veers toward D minor with a darker, half-diminished sonority. The music surges upward through a sequence of keys—D minor, F minor, then A flat minor—growing increasingly intense, propelled by a sharp dotted-eighth rhythm. At its peak, a dissonant German augmented sixth chord wrenches the harmony before resolving into a brooding A flat minor. From there, the storm gradually subsides: the relentless pulse eases, the pitch and volume descend, and repeated dominant chords give way to a series of soft, inverted major triads that settle on a C major chord—now transformed into the dominant of F major—as the tempo slows and the fury dissipates.
