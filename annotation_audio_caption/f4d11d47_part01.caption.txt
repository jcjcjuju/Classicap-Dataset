A bold, balanced theme unfolds in the home key, structured in clear four-bar phrases; after reaching a moment of suspense halfway through, it returns an octave lower, now resolving with a strong sense of closure. This leads into a transitional passage that begins with a steady bass note under shifting harmonies, then flips its melodic lines upside down in a brief echo. A winding descent follows, guiding the music toward a brighter key, where repeated emphatic chords create mounting anticipation. A lyrical new theme then emerges in this brighter tonality, its opening idea gently expanded and reshaped upon return, with inner voices echoing the melody at a distance and rapid, flowing notes recalling earlier flourishes. The section closes with a short coda that weaves together fragments of the opening theme and its quick ornamental figures, tying the exposition together before the music begins anew.
