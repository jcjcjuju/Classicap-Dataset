The music begins with a subtle reworking of the opening bold theme, now developed with intricate contrapuntal interplay as the voices invert and then return to their original orientation. Rapid thirty-second-note flourishes emerge, derived from the second melody, preceded by slightly stretched sixteenth-note figures that echo the same material in augmented rhythm. This leads into a modified transitional passage that guides the harmony back to the home key. What follows is a varied restatement of the earlier bridge and second theme, now firmly grounded in the stable, resonant tonality of E flat major rather than the brighter dominant key. A brief linking gesture then prepares a repeat of this large section. After the repeat, the movement concludes with a short coda that recalls the character and shape of the very first bars, bringing the piece to a gentle and familiar close.
