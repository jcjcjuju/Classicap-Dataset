A new theme emerges in a somber, minor mode, built from a concise, recurring figure that shapes nearly all the material. This theme begins with a clear sense of instability and gradually shifts toward a brighter, related key, arriving at a moment of resolution. What follows is a contrapuntal passage where the figure is echoed between voices, creating a layered, imitative texture that builds momentum and lands in a more luminous major key. The opening portion of the theme then returns with subtle alterations, preserving its essential character while refreshing its sound. This leads into a recurrence of the imitative section, now slightly reshaped near its end to create a strong sense of anticipation by settling on a harmonically tense, unresolved chord. The music then unfolds a transitional passage that subtly prepares the ear for what is to come, weaving fragments of earlier ideas into a fluid, forward-moving stream.
