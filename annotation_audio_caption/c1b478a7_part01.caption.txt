A bold, energetic theme in G major opens the movement, establishing a stable and bright home key. This is followed by contrasting new material that begins with a balanced four-bar phrase in the same key, then shifts to a brighter, more tense four-bar phrase in the dominant, landing firmly in A major. During this episode, a low-register idea from earlier briefly appears in the upper voice, adding a sense of interplay. A new rhythmic figure then emerges over a sustained tone that creates mounting tension, leading the music to settle into the key of D major. A brief transitional passage follows, smoothly guiding the harmony back toward the original G major. The opening theme then returns exactly as before—its confident character and familiar shape restored in the home key.
