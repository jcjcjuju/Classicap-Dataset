A bold, two-bar rhythmic theme returns in the home key of F minor, sounding stable and grounded. It leads into a transitional passage that echoes earlier material but is reshaped to stay within the tonic key, creating a sense of cohesion. A contrasting lyrical theme follows, now also firmly in F minor instead of its earlier distant key, giving it a darker, more resolved quality. The movement closes with a coda that recalls the earlier closing material, now transposed to the home key and slightly extended, reinforcing the sense of finality and closure.
