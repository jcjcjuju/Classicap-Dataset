A brief developmental passage unfolds, built from fragments of the bold, energetic theme first heard at the opening. These fragments are passed through a series of shifting harmonic landscapes—first a somber E minor, then a brighter C major, followed by the introspective hues of A minor—before settling into G major, all while maintaining a sense of forward motion through sequential repetition. The music ultimately arrives at a point of poised tension, clearly pointing toward the dominant, setting up a strong expectation for resolution.
