The music opens with a bright, resonant D major statement, quickly unfolding into flowing arpeggiated figures that span a wide range of the keyboard. A strong sense of arrival emerges as the harmony settles firmly on the dominant, creating a clear point of stability. From there, the music embarks on a restless harmonic journey—shifting through E minor, B minor, F-sharp minor, B major, and back to E minor—each key coloring the arpeggiated texture with subtle changes in mood, before finally returning home to D major with a decisive, resolved cadence. This entire span feels like an expansive exploration that begins and ends in a place of clarity, yet wanders through distant tonal landscapes in between.
