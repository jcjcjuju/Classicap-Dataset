The music begins with a passage that echoes the bold, structured character of the opening theme, unfolding in a bright major mode before settling into a darker, more resolved mood with a conclusive cadence in the minor mode of the home key. This gives way to an extended, restless episode built from the rhythmic and melodic shape of the earlier transition figure, now animated by a continuous stream of rapid triplet motion. The harmony shifts constantly, moving through a series of shadowy minor keys and brief glimpses of major warmth, creating a sense of searching and instability. Midway, the musical lines flip upside down, adding a layer of contrapuntal intrigue, and later flip back as the harmony circles toward a pause that feels suspended and unresolved, colored by striking dissonances that heighten the tension before the next section begins.
