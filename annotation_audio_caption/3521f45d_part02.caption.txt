A new section begins with a somber melody in G minor, unfolding in two distinct halves. The first half ends with a sense of suspension, its unresolved close approached by a striking, dissonant chord that adds tension before the pause. The second half revisits similar melodic material but reshapes its ending to land firmly and conclusively, offering resolution where there was previously openness. During this second half, the musical lines briefly trade places, creating a subtle shift in texture. The entire episode then dissolves into a short transitional passage that gently shifts the tonal center upward, guiding the ear toward a brighter key and setting up the return of the main theme.
