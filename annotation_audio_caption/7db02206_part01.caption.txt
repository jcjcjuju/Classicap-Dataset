A bold, tightly constructed theme in C minor unfolds, built entirely from its first six notes. This is followed by a transitional passage that echoes fragments of the opening theme over a sustained C in the bass, then gives way to elaborate, flowing lines that culminate in a striking G major chord—an unexpected harmonic turn before the music settles into the warmer key of E flat major. There, a contrasting lyrical theme emerges, graceful and more relaxed, which soon undergoes a brief elaboration of its closing idea. The section draws to a close with a coda that revisits the initial six-note motif, now transformed: first heard low in the bass in E flat major, then echoed higher in the treble. A short phrase is played twice with subtle changes, and later another three-bar segment receives the same treatment. The entire passage gently fades out over a sustained E flat in the bass, creating a sense of calm finality.
