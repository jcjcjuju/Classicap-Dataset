A new episode begins in C major with a clear four-bar phrase, which is then immediately restated at a higher pitch level, creating a sense of upward motion and brightness. This entire idea returns once more with noticeable variation, enriching the melodic contour or harmonic color while retaining its essential shape. The music then transitions through a short, purposeful passage that builds momentum, guiding the ear toward the return of the main theme.
