A bold, structured theme unfolds in the home key, built from four-bar phrases that create a sense of balance and expectation; it concludes with a strong resolution after briefly hesitating with a surprise harmonic turn. This is followed by an extended, wandering passage that shifts through several keys—first brightening into the relative major, then reshaping the main theme in contrasting minor and major hues, while weaving in subtle references to other tonal areas, all driven by repeating melodic patterns that spiral toward a tense pause in a new key. From there emerges a melody that mirrors the opening theme but upside-down, set in an unexpected minor key typically avoided for such material, and drawing entirely on earlier ideas without introducing new ones. A linking section then follows, its lower and inner voices echoing each other in a cascading pattern before arriving at another unresolved pause, enriched by a striking, bittersweet chord. The main theme returns clearly in the home key, but instead of closing decisively, it flows directly into a transformed version of the earlier linking material, now grounded in the tonic, creating a rare and seamless continuation rather than a conventional ending.
