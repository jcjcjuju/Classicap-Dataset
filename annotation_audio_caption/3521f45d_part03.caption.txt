A complete and stable statement of the main theme returns in the home key, followed by a brief connecting passage that shifts the music into the warm, contrasting key of E flat major. There, a new lyrical melody unfolds, resolving with a clear sense of closure before embarking on a journey through shifting harmonic colors—passing through C minor, B flat major, and back to E flat—each step echoing the previous in a cascading sequence, ultimately arriving at a moment of poised anticipation in the home key. A short transitional passage then leads into a partial return of the main theme, now subtly altered: first heard nestled within the inner voices beneath a sustained harmonic layer, then immediately restated with the musical lines flipped upside down, briefly touching on the brighter key of F major at its close. This is followed by a swift descent of triplet figures that usher in the earlier secondary melody, now firmly rooted in the home key. After a fleeting two-bar link, the main theme makes its final appearance—exactly as first heard, but extended by three emphatic closing bars that strongly reaffirm the home key.
