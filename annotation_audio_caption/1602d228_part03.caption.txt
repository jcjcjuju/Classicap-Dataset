A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, unfolding in two balanced phrases but now altered in its final moment to land on a tense, unresolved dominant seventh chord in F major. This harmonic instability launches a transitional passage that begins in F major and smoothly shifts toward C major, mirroring the earlier modulation but transposed. The lyrical second theme then appears, now securely anchored in the tonic key, offering a sense of resolution and stability. The movement concludes with a brief coda: a rapid, rippling figure in thirty-second notes emerges in the bass, immediately echoed a beat later in the treble, while the harmony colors the opening motif of the main theme with fresh, chromatic inflections, including a striking dissonant chord that adds fleeting tension before the final close.
