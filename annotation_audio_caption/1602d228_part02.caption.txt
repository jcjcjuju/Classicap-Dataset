The music begins with a somber, unsettled passage in D minor, echoing a brief linking idea heard earlier, now varied and passed from the low register to the high. This leads into a bold, recognizable theme—first heard at the opening of the movement—but now fragmented and shortened each time it returns. It first appears in D minor, then shifts to C major, and finally settles in A minor, where the melodic and bass lines swap roles. A fleeting, inverted fragment of the theme flickers briefly before the harmony circles insistently around A minor, landing three times on a tense, unresolved cadence built from a dramatic augmented sixth chord resolving to a dominant. This tension dissolves into a swift, sliding chromatic line that sweeps downward, preparing the return of the main theme.
