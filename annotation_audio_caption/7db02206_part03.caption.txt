A bold, six-note theme in C minor returns with its original character intact. This is followed by a transitional passage that echoes fragments of the opening theme without changing key, maintaining a sense of continuity. A lyrical second theme then unfolds in the unexpected brightness of C major, though it soon drifts back toward the somber tone of C minor by its close. The music then enters a final section that begins firmly in the home key, only to shift suddenly into the distant, hushed color of D flat major; here, a poised, unresolved tension emerges as the second theme’s opening phrase sounds twice, each time halting on a dominant seventh chord. A swift, shadowy modulation—spun through a diminished seventh chord—bridges back to C minor, where the music settles into a grounded, resonant pedal tone. Over this steady foundation, the opening gestures of both the second and first themes alternate, their distinct profiles intertwining in quiet dialogue before the movement comes to rest.
