The music opens with a brief introductory passage that sets the stage without presenting a clear theme. A distinct first subject then emerges with a somber, grounded quality in C sharp minor, soon shifting toward a brighter, more open sound as it arrives in E major. This leads seamlessly into a transitional passage that feels like an extension of the first idea, moving through darker harmonic colors from E minor to B minor. Finally, a contrasting second subject appears, beginning with a warm, lyrical character in B major before turning more restless and unresolved as it settles into F sharp minor.
