A bold, rhythmically intricate theme returns in the home key, its opening shaped by three-bar phrases that shift into two-bar patterns, rich with imitative interplay. This is followed by a brief, rising sequence that echoes the theme’s shape, stretched slightly longer than before and steering toward a bright, expectant harmony that sets up the home key’s dominant. A contrasting lyrical idea then unfolds, now settled warmly in the tonic, accompanied by subtle echoes of the main theme. The movement closes with a sustained, grounding bass note beneath fragments of the opening theme, creating a resonant, stable conclusion.
