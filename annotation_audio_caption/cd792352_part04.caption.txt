A lively variation unfolds with rhythmic syncopations interwoven with rapid arpeggiated figures in thirty-second notes. The melodic material is transformed through inversion: the opening idea is first presented, then restated upside-down, and this inverted version is itself mirrored in the final section, creating a layered, symmetrical play of motion and rhythm—all without repetition, flowing continuously from one transformation to the next.
