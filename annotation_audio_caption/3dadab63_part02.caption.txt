A transitional passage begins with familiar melodic material, then shifts through darker harmonic colors—first into G minor, then settling into the warm, stable key of E flat major, where a new, lyrical melody unfolds. This melody is cut short by an unexpected harmonic turn: instead of a full resolution, the music veers away with an interrupted cadence, soon slipping into the somber key of C minor. There, the bold opening phrase of the main theme suddenly returns, now recast in B flat major before quickly shifting into its minor mode. The music then drifts through fleeting, distant tonalities—G flat major and E flat minor—before anchoring in B flat minor. A sustained, linking passage follows, echoing earlier material but extended in length, and colored by striking augmented sixth chords that heighten tension before guiding the music back toward the main theme.
