A fragment of the bold, six-bar opening theme returns, sounding stable yet incomplete. It gives way to a new connecting passage that briefly echoes the tail end of that theme before weaving in melodic shapes reminiscent of the lyrical second subject. The gentle, flowing character of the second subject then reappears, now grounded in the home key and subtly extended. The movement closes with a return of the original transitional material—slightly altered to reaffirm the tonic—leading to a quiet, conclusive restatement of the codetta’s closing gesture, now fully resolved in the home key.
