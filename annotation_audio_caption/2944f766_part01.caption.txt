The music opens with a compact, energetic theme in the home key, its two phrases tightly woven together by an overlap that shortens the expected structure. This leads without pause into a transitional passage that remains in the same key, featuring lively sixteenth-note figures that shift from the lower to the upper register, building momentum until it lands on a clear point of pause that feels unresolved. A new, more lyrical idea then emerges in a brighter, closely related key, presented in two balanced phrases that echo each other, the second closing more definitively than the first. This is followed by a passage built on a repeating short motif that shifts pitch with each recurrence, briefly swapping voices between hands before settling into a flowing melody shaped in two-bar segments—each beginning identically with the same three notes, and the latter half mirroring the former. The section winds down with a brief closing gesture derived from the slurred eighth notes of the melody, creating a subtle but significant musical seed that lingers before the music begins anew.
