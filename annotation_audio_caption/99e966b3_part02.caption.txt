The music begins in a new, unexpected key with a bold, rhythmic idea that echoes the opening theme’s distinctive pulse—short, assertive gestures followed by a sense of forward motion. This rhythmic pattern drives much of the passage, unfolding through shifting harmonies and fragmented echoes of the original melody, creating a feeling of exploration and instability. Tension builds steadily as the harmony grows increasingly unsettled, culminating in a strong, unresolved dissonance that hangs in the air, poised for resolution.
