A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, unfolding in two balanced phrases that end with a sense of suspension rather than resolution. This is followed by a transitional passage that now remains anchored in the tonic key, guiding the music smoothly toward the return of the lyrical second theme. That second theme, originally heard in a brighter key, now appears in the stable, grounded tonality of the home key, its graceful melody extended through repeated cadential gestures that build anticipation before finally settling into a conclusive close, now made more emphatic by two added bars that firmly seal the ending.
