A bold, compact version of the opening theme returns in D minor, missing its second portion. This leads into a transformed transitional passage: its initial gesture is reshaped, then shifts to B flat major, creating a brighter but fleeting contrast. The second theme follows, now grounded in the home key of D minor, lending it a darker, more resolved character than its earlier appearance. The movement concludes with a vivid coda: the opening motif echoes in the bass beneath a flurry of rapid sixteenth notes, then the bass climbs chromatically upward in a tense, winding ascent. Dissonant diminished seventh chords color the harmony intensely, before the music settles onto a sustained A in the bass, around which faint echoes of the main theme flicker, drawing the piece to a close with a sense of lingering tension and quiet finality.
