A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, unfolding with balanced phrasing and closing decisively. It leads into a modified transitional passage that feels more expansive, its melody flowing through a series of key changes—touching on F major, D major, and C major—with a clear descending pattern in the upper voice. The lyrical second subject follows, now anchored firmly in the home key, beginning with a delicately irregular phrase that soon gives way to a contrasting section built on flowing broken chords; this latter idea is restated and slightly extended, creating a sense of gentle elaboration. The movement concludes with a coda that echoes the earlier closing material, now subtly expanded, featuring a pair of descending lines answered immediately by rising ones, bringing the music to a graceful and resolved finish.
