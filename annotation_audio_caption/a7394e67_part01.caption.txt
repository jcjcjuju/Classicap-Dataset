A bold, angular theme emerges in the alto, soon overlapped by a closely related answering phrase in the treble, accompanied by a brief counter-melody in the alto. The theme then appears in the bass, now paired with the counter-melody in the treble, leading to a short closing gesture. The theme returns in the treble with the counter-melody now in the bass, followed by the answering phrase in the alto and then in the bass, each time accompanied by the counter-melody in the treble. After another brief closing passage, the music shifts to a darker mood as the theme reappears in the treble in a new key, followed by a transitional passage that winds through related keys. The theme is then heard in the alto without its usual counter-melody, leading into another modulating passage that gradually returns toward the home key. The theme enters again in the bass, then the answering phrase sounds alone in the treble, before the theme reappears in the alto now reunited with its counter-melody in the treble. A final extended transition cycles through several keys before settling back into the home tonality. The theme is then clearly restated in the treble with its counter-melody in the alto, leading into a concluding passage that ends with a fragment of the answering phrase in the bass, subtly reshaped to bring the music to a close.
