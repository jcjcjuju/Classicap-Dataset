A new theme emerges in A flat major, lyrical and distinct from what preceded it. This theme is soon varied, its character subtly reshaped while retaining its essential shape. Following this, a passage of imitative counterpoint unfolds over four bars, after which the same theme returns once more in a further varied form. The music then settles onto a sustained dominant note, creating a sense of anticipation through a prolonged harmonic tension that gradually builds toward the return of the opening theme.
