A stately introductory theme in A flat major unfolds with a stable, grounded quality, frequently resting on richly colored tonic chords in second inversion and occasionally spiced with tense, fleeting diminished seventh harmonies. This gives way to a section grounded in tonic and dominant harmonies, where the left hand moves with subtle chromatic descent beneath a lyrical right-hand melody, later enriched by expressive suspensions and appoggiaturas that create gentle dissonances resolving into warmth. The music then journeys through shifting tonal landscapes—first to B flat minor, then C minor—before settling into the brighter C major, where the melody is adorned with ornamental notes that lean into the chord tones, all while a subtle rhythmic tension emerges from cross-rhythms in the right hand. The opening theme returns, now expanded: after a faithful restatement, it ascends through a rising sequence that briefly visits distant keys, then reappears an octave higher with heightened brilliance. The closing gesture is powerfully reinforced in the bass with deep double octaves before the passage concludes with a clear, resonant arrival on the home chord of A flat major.
