The music begins with a clear establishment of a stable home key, setting a grounded foundation before introducing a distinct theme built from a simple three-note figure in the bass. This theme unfolds with purpose and resolves into a moment of strong closure that feels bright and expectant, shifting to a closely related key. The music then moves through a series of harmonic destinations—first settling into a darker, minor mood, then briefly touching warmer major areas and other contrasting keys, creating a sense of wandering before finding temporary rest in a more distant minor tonality. A steady, resonant bass note then emerges and holds firm beneath layered melodic lines that rise in a stepwise, echoing pattern, building gentle momentum. Finally, the music returns decisively to its original home key, affirming it with a conclusive and satisfying resolution.
