A bold, energetic theme returns, closely resembling the movement’s opening material, with its characteristic four-bar phrasing and melodic sequences. This is followed by an extended transitional passage that begins simply but soon shifts through darker harmonic colors—first to the tonic minor, then to brighter and more distant keys like F major and A minor. A flowing sequence emerges, driven by rapid sixteenth-note figures now in the bass, weaving through a series of modulations—A major, G major, F major, D minor, and finally G minor—each shift marked by a distinctive, tense chord that resolves with a sense of urgency. Fragments of earlier themes reappear, inverted and reshaped: the second subject’s opening is heard upside down, then the first subject’s continuation follows suit, now guiding the harmony from G minor toward A minor. A rising imitative dialogue unfolds between high and low voices, each entry overlapping the last, building momentum until the imitation tightens and gives way to sweeping arpeggios. The section closes with a clear, familiar cadential gesture—identical to the original transition’s ending—but now firmly rooted in F major.
