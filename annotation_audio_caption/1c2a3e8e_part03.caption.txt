A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, now condensed and reshaped, closing with a repeated two-bar idea that expands into three bars—first glowing warmly in D major, then resolving firmly into the stable brightness of A major. This leads into a transitional passage, transformed from its earlier form, which now winds its way toward the somber hues of A minor. The lyrical second theme follows, beginning with a gentle melancholy in A minor before gradually brightening and culminating in the reassuring warmth of A major, nearly unchanged from its initial appearance. The movement concludes with a final section built from earlier material, now anchored in the home key but subtly reshaped in its lowest voice.
