A bold, somber theme begins in a minor key, establishing a stable yet dark tonal center; this idea is immediately restated in a brighter, major mode before giving way to a closing phrase that is then heard again. Throughout, melodic lines in the upper voice are mirrored upside-down shortly after their initial appearance. The music then enters a section of restless activity, weaving fragments of the opening theme into shifting harmonic terrain. Finally, the main theme returns in its original minor key, now more compact and conclusive, firmly reestablishing the home tonality with a sense of finality.
