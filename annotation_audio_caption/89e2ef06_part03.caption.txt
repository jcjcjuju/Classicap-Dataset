A bold, energetic theme in D major is heard, followed by a slightly altered version of the same theme now sounding brighter and more tense as it shifts to A major. This entire passage returns once more with subtle changes, maintaining its clear, stable character in the home key before giving way to a sequence of short, winding phrases that cascade through different tonal centers—first settling into A major, then shifting to the darker hue of B minor, and finally arriving at a moment of suspenseful tension. The music then circles back to the opening theme in its original key, now extended and firmly resolved in D major, reaffirming a sense of return and stability.
