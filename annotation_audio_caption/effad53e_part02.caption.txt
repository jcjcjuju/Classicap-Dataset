The music unfolds with material drawn from the bold, energetic opening gesture of the first subject and the closing Coda theme, now reshaped and explored through shifting harmonic colors and fragmented textures. These familiar ideas are developed with a sense of urgency and instability, weaving through various keys while maintaining their recognizable contours. The passage builds tension steadily, culminating in a sustained dissonance that creates a strong pull toward resolution, landing on a dominant seventh chord that hangs expectantly in the air.
