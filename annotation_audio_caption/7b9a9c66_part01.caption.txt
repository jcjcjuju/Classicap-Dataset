A bold, angular subject emerges in the alto, establishing a somber mood in G minor. It is soon answered in the treble with a version subtly altered to affirm a new tonal center, while a contrasting counter-melody weaves beneath in the alto. A brief codetta offers a momentary pause before the subject returns in the bass, now accompanied by the counter-subject in the treble, restoring the home key. The answer then appears in the tenor, supported by the counter-subject in the bass, shifting toward a brighter D major. A flowing episode follows, built from fragments of the subject’s second half, guiding the harmony through G minor to B-flat major. The subject reappears in the alto over a tenor counterpoint in B-flat, then the answer enters in the bass with the tenor continuing the counter-subject, now in F major—repeated immediately in the treble with the bass responding. The subject returns in the bass with treble counterpoint in B-flat, leading into a tight, incomplete stretto where the answer overlaps in the alto in E-flat major. After a brief return of the subject in the bass with alto counterpoint in C minor, it resurfaces in the treble with a slightly varied bass counter-subject in the same key. An answer in the alto, paired with treble counterpoint, brings a temporary close in G minor. A second episode unfolds, featuring a new rhythmic figure alternating between treble and alto over a bass line derived from the subject, moving through E-flat major before returning to G minor. A dense, complete stretto then ensues: the subject appears in treble, tenor, and finally bass, all in G minor, with the counter-subject threading through the alto and bass. The subject is heard once more in the alto with bass counterpoint, and finally in the tenor, which carries the music to a quiet close—ending not in the expected minor, but with a surprising, gentle major chord.
