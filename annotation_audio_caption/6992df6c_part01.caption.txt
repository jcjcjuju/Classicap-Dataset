The music opens with a confident theme in a stable, warm key, its first gesture ending with a sense of unresolved tension. This is followed by a clear, lyrical melody that unfolds over a longer span, ultimately settling into a firm, conclusive cadence in the home key. A sparkling cascade of arpeggios then takes over, fluidly steering the harmony toward a brighter, more expectant tonal area; this transition shifts character midway through, leading to a decisive arrival in the new key. A contrasting passage follows—short, grounded by a repeating bass pattern that slightly varies on its third iteration—maintaining this new tonal center from start to finish. The section closes with a fresh, compact musical idea, immediately echoed with subtle alteration, offering a brief moment of reflection before the next phase begins.
