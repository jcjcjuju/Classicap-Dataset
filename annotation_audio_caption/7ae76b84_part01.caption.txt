A bold, energetic theme unfolds in the home key, structured as a balanced phrase that briefly pauses with a sense of anticipation before continuing; this initial idea is extended by repeating its latter portion, ultimately arriving at a conclusive, stable ending. The music then shifts into a transitional passage built from the opening motif, which is immediately restated and then varied three times in quick succession, followed by a slower, stretched-out version of its beginning; during this process, the harmony moves smoothly into a brighter key, landing on an open, unresolved cadence. A new, lyrical theme emerges in this new key, unfolding in clear four-bar segments: its first half ends with a gentle suspension, then returns with subtle changes before closing firmly. This is followed by a more compact idea that is extended through repetition of its closing portion, with the musical lines swapping roles at the start of the repeat. A final, brief section presents a self-contained phrase that ends decisively, then returns once more, this time lingering longer on two sustained harmonies to create a gentle expansion. The exposition closes with a short, distinctive tag derived from the earlier stretched motif, now inverted in contour and heard twice.
