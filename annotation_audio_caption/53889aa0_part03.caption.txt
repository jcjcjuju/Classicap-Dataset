The music returns with a bold, energetic theme in the home key, though it is cut short and reshaped—its final phrase turned upside down from its original form, creating a fresh yet familiar contour. Over this, a flurry of triplet sixteenth notes weaves in, drawn from earlier lyrical material, blending the movement’s two main ideas into a single texture. A brief, transitional passage follows, smoothly guiding the ear forward. The second theme then reappears, now grounded in the tonic key and inverted from its initial presentation, unfolding in two distinct spans: the first built on the transformed opening motive in the bass with a new treble counterpoint, the second introducing a new melody over a sustained pedal tone, enriched by fleeting harmonic detours. The movement closes with a concise coda that toys with expectation—first halting on a deceptive, unresolved cadence colored by a brief shift into G minor, then pressing onward through repeated cadential gestures that briefly hint at E flat major and C minor before finally settling into a conclusive close.
