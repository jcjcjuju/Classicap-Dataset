A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, now subtly altered in its details. This gives way to a passage that initially echoes the earlier episode’s opening gesture, but soon introduces new ideas shaped by the rhythmic character of the main theme. The varied main theme then reappears once more in the home key, reaffirming its presence before the music moves into a striking coda. There, a series of ascending patterns unfolds, followed by a moment of suspended harmony on a rich, complex chord. In the final bars, the theme’s outline emerges in the bass while shimmering chromatic lines race above, all anchored by a sustained harmonic foundation that holds firm until the very end.
