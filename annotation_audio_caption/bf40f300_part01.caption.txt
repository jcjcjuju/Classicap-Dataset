A distinctive ornamental figure, heard twice in every bar, forms the foundation of this prelude. It begins with a clear, harmonically stable phrase that resolves with a strong sense of arrival in the dominant key. The music then unfolds through a series of shifting tonal centers—moving from G sharp major to D sharp minor, then to A sharp minor, and onward through F sharp major and other related keys—creating a fluid, exploratory harmonic journey that ultimately settles with a firm resolution in the home key of C sharp. A brief transitional passage follows, guiding the ear with another decisive cadence in G sharp, which sets up a shift in character: the texture becomes imitative and contrapuntal in a lively three-voice fugato. This section briefly touches the tonic key with clarity before drifting through related minor modes and finally circling back to the original tonal center, bringing the movement to a cohesive close.
