The music opens with a theme that begins in a stable, somber home key but quickly shifts toward a brighter, more open sound before settling into a darker, related tonality; this idea returns immediately, now starting in that brighter key and winding its way into a more tense, unsettled mood. A new phrase follows, continuing from the brighter area and gradually building expectation until it halts on a chord that strongly pulls back toward the original home key, which then arrives clearly in a short, grounded passage that is heard twice, firmly closing the section in that stable, somber tonality. A transitional passage begins in this same home key, then presents a lyrical idea first in a warm, distant key, then restates it in a more melancholic one; fragments of this idea appear again in an even more remote, hazy tonality before the harmony twists through a tense, dissonant chord that propels the music into a new theme—this one unfolding in a brooding, minor key rather than the expected brighter contrast. This new theme is presented and then immediately returns with subtle variation. The section closes with a brief coda that wraps up the exposition.
