The music opens with a bold, restless theme that begins in the dark, unsettled sound of G minor, briefly brightens into G major, then returns to a minor mode—this time in C minor, establishing a sense of home that feels unexpectedly shifted. A transitional passage follows, starting with a sudden, luminous shift to A-flat major before quickly veering into the somber tones of F minor; within this transition, a fleeting echo of the opening G-minor idea appears, soon swept away by a swift scale that propels the music forward. This leads to a contrasting second theme, warmly lyrical and radiant in G major—a key that feels bright and assertive, though unusually placed. The section closes with a brief, anticipatory passage that subtly prepares for what is to come, creating a sense of continuity rather than closure.
