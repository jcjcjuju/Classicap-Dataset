The music begins with a bold, energetic theme in the upper voice, soon joined by a second theme that intertwines with it; by the fifth bar, a new three-part figure appears above a now lower-voiced version of the first theme, creating layered motion. A fourth, more episodic idea enters in the treble, offering contrast before sequential patterns unfold, driving the harmony toward a stable resolution in D major. This sense of arrival quickly gives way to a new section where the opening themes return briefly, now leading into fresh material that builds through repeated sequences and modulations, culminating in a firm cadence in F-sharp minor. The music then shifts again, presenting transposed fragments from earlier—now a fourth lower—amid continued sequential development that heightens tension until it pauses expectantly on an unresolved, inverted dominant ninth chord. From this suspended moment, the opening themes reemerge transformed, now grounded in the home key of B, and are soon accompanied by a decorative, turn-based variation of the second theme. These elements converge with growing clarity and stability, finally settling into a conclusive, peaceful cadence in the tonic.
