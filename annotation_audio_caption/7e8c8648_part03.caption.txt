A bold, energetic theme returns firmly grounded in the home key, unfolding with a sense of stability and purpose. This is followed immediately by a brief, seamless transition that leads without pause into a lyrical second theme—initially heard in the brighter, more expectant key of the dominant before gently settling back into the comforting familiarity of the tonic. The second theme unfolds in three distinct phases: the first presents a graceful idea that shifts from tension to resolution, the second offers a balanced pair of phrases ending with a conclusive cadence, and the third repeats its material with subtle embellishments. The movement then draws to a close with a coda that evokes earlier developmental material, now anchored by a sustained bass note and colored by gentle, hymn-like harmonic shifts that softly affirm the home key.
