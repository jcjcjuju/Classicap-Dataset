A clear, stable melody unfolds in E flat major, concluding with a strong, resolving cadence that firmly establishes the home key. This is followed by a transitional passage that shifts harmonic direction, creating a sense of movement and leading to a point of gentle tension—an inverted cadence that sets up B flat major as a new tonal center. A contrasting second melody then emerges in this brighter, related key, flowing smoothly until it momentarily stalls with an unexpected, unresolved cadence; the preceding phrase returns with subtle variation and now closes decisively with a full cadence in B flat. A brief, linking gesture immediately follows, smoothly guiding the harmony back toward E flat major and preparing for what comes next.
