A bold, energetic theme opens with dotted rhythms over a steady stream of eighth-note accompaniment, establishing a bright A major tonality before briefly slipping into the darker hues of B minor. This theme returns in a transformed version in F sharp minor, where the bass echoes the melody in close imitation, creating a layered, introspective effect. The music then circles back to the original theme in A major, now subtly varied but still grounded by a clear, resolving cadence. A sudden shift follows: triplets emerge in a fleeting transition, their rhythmic energy and a sharpened leading tone smoothly guiding the harmony toward the brighter, expectant realm of E major. There, a new lyrical melody unfolds—graceful and balanced—before momentarily retreating into shadowy minor keys as it shifts to the bass register, only to reassert itself in E major with a firm cadence. The section closes with a winding, rhythmically familiar idea derived from the second theme, colored by expressive chromatic notes and anchored by a persistent low A pedal, reinforcing the stability of the dominant key.
