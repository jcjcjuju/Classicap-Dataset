The prelude opens with a lively, spring-like character, driven by bold octave leaps in the bass. It begins with a stable, grounded feel that soon shifts through a series of fleeting tonal colors—brightening into D major, then briefly darkening through A minor and E minor—before resolving with a strong, conclusive cadence in D major. This is followed by a passage anchored by a sustained dominant tone, over which the harmony gently drifts through C major before reaffirming D major, ultimately settling with clear finality into the home key.
