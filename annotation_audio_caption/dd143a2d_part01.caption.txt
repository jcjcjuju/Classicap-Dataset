A bold, angular theme emerges in the alto voice, establishing a somber mood in A minor, soon answered by a higher, closely related version in the treble that shifts the tonal center toward E minor. A brief closing gesture follows, leading to the theme’s return in the deep bass, again in A minor, and then another responsive statement in the tenor, reinforcing the E minor inflection. The music then transforms as the theme appears upside-down in the treble, now brightened by G major, and this inverted form quickly passes through the alto and tenor before plunging into D major in the bass. It returns to A minor through the alto, after which the texture intensifies: the original theme overlaps itself between treble and tenor, then alto and bass present the answer in tight canon, creating a dense interweaving of lines. This contrapuntal energy continues as the subject reappears in tenor and alto in close imitation, followed by a transitional passage that fluidly shifts from A minor to C major. In this new key, the subject resounds simultaneously in treble and bass, then unfolds in fragments through tenor and alto. An inverted answer emerges in D minor, shared between alto and tenor, capped by a short cadential phrase. The subject returns in G major with treble and bass in stretto, again followed by a codetta. Back in A minor, the inverted subject weaves between treble and alto, then the inverted answer echoes between bass and tenor. The music ventures into D minor as the subject sounds in bass and tenor, immediately countered by the answer in tenor and bass pulling back toward A minor, while the inverted answer and inverted subject continue to chase each other across treble and alto, briefly touching D minor again. A new lyrical episode unfolds, steering the harmony from D minor to F major, where the inverted subject is passed between bass and alto. A fleeting inverted answer in C major involves all three upper voices, then the subject itself—now in D minor—overlaps densely among alto, tenor, and treble. After a moment of silence, the original theme returns in alto and treble in A minor, immediately followed by its answer in the treble, now unexpectedly colored by E major. The final bars settle onto a sustained A, as the three upper voices layer the theme in close imitation, resolving peacefully into a warm, major-key close.
