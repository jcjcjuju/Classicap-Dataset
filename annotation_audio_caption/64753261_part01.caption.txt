The music opens with a clear, stable theme in the home key, establishing a strong sense of arrival and foundation. This is followed by brief supplementary material that extends the initial idea without introducing new themes. A transitional passage then unfolds, shifting harmonic ground and building momentum toward a contrasting section. In this new section, a lyrical melody emerges in a brighter, related key, structured in balanced four-bar phrases; it reaches a moment of partial arrival halfway through, then returns with subtle variation to close fully and decisively. Throughout, the opening melodic gesture echoes in the lower register, creating a layered dialogue. A shorter, repeated phrase follows, its conclusion gently stretched by lingering cadential harmonies that hover before resolving. A brief connecting passage then leads back to the return of the original theme, now restated in full within the home key, reaffirming its central role. From there, the music moves into a modified version of the earlier transition, now steering through a series of shifting tonal centers—touching on distant keys with successive cadences—until it settles on a poised, expectant half-cadence that opens the door to a new episode.
