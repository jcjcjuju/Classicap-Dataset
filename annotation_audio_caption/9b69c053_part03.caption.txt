A bold, energetic theme in E major returns unchanged, presenting its initial four-bar idea followed by its varied repetition and subsequent eight-bar extension that modulates and settles back into the home key. This is followed by a transitional passage reminiscent of earlier material, now reshaped to affirm the tonic key. The second subject then enters, now comfortably rooted in E major instead of the dominant, unfolding with a sustained harmonic foundation before expanding into new development of the opening theme’s early gestures; it culminates in a tightly woven imitative passage built on harmonies that create a strong sense of tension and forward motion. The main theme reappears once more, but transformed: its melody now flows within the middle voices while rapid sixteenth-note figures dance above, and the familiar opening phrase is not restated. The movement closes with a coda drawing from earlier ideas, including a clear restatement of the theme’s first section, bringing the music to a resolved and satisfying conclusion.
