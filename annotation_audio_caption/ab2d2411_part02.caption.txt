A somber passage in B flat minor unfolds, shifting to a brighter D flat major, then returns with its musical lines flipped upside down. This same material reappears again, now starting in D flat major and winding back to B flat minor, once more with the parts reversed. After a brief pause in B flat minor, the music suddenly accelerates into a lively Presto theme that begins darkly but moves toward a more assertive F major; this theme is then restated with variation, now launching from F major and circling back to B flat minor. The energy of this faster section continues in a transitional passage that builds momentum, drawing from the Presto’s character and guiding the music back toward the opening material.
