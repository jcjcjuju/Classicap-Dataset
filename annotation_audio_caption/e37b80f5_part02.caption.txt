The music unfolds with restless, swirling arpeggios that create harmonic tension, shifting between A flat major and minor, then moving to G flat major before settling back into D flat major. A slower, chorale-like theme emerges in D flat major—broad and hymn-like—initially familiar but soon extended and transformed, eventually drifting into the darker, more somber colors of B flat minor. This same theme is then developed through a series of sequential repetitions, each step drawing the harmony closer to C sharp minor, anchored by a sustained dominant pedal that builds anticipation through its persistent pull toward resolution.
