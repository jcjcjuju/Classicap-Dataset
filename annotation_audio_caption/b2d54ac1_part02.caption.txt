A new melody unfolds, distinct from earlier themes, followed by a passage centered on the note D that soon shifts toward G major, transforming D into a dominant pitch. Over this harmonic foundation, a descending sequence emerges, creating a sense of motion and tension through characteristic dominant harmonies that build anticipation, ultimately guiding the music back to the return of the opening theme.
