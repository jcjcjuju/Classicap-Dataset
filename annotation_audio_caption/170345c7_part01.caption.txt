A bold, rhythmic theme in C major unfolds, built from a single opening rhythmic idea and concluding after eight bars; this is followed by a varied and extended restatement of its closing portion. A new, contrasting passage then emerges, introducing fresh material that builds tension by landing unexpectedly on the dominant harmony rather than resolving firmly. This leads into a lyrical second theme, first presented in G minor with a two-bar phrase followed by a four-bar continuation, then shifting to G major for a brighter, more stable rendition of the same thematic idea. The section closes with a brief, distinct motif that will later reappear at the start of the development.
