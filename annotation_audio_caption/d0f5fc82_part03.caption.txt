A bold, energetic theme returns in the home key, unfolding with melodic grace followed by a more rhythmically driven continuation that extends through repeated cadential gestures. This leads into a transitional passage that expands beyond its earlier form, weaving through darker harmonic colors with a sequential phrase in C minor and B-flat major before steering firmly toward the tonic. The second subject then arrives in the home key, beginning with a lyrical passage in the bass, followed by a shift to minor mode with a lower-octave echo, sequential motion touching on a brighter key, and a return to minor with repeated half-cadences; it ultimately resolves into a warm major-mode conclusion, restated an octave higher with extended cadential flourishes. The movement closes with a brief codetta, mirroring the earlier closing gesture but now grounded securely in the tonic.
