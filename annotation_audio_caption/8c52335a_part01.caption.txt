A bold, energetic theme in G major unfolds over eight bars, establishing a stable, bright tonal center. This is followed by a sustained passage built entirely on a tense, expectant dominant seventh chord, creating a sense of harmonic suspension. The opening theme then returns, now condensed into six bars, reaffirming the home key. A contrasting section follows in a gentler, more introspective mood, shifting to E minor and structured in clear four-bar phrases; it briefly touches on A minor before resolving back toward G major with another dominant seventh chord. The bold opening theme reappears once more in its original key, restoring the initial character. This is succeeded by eight bars of persistent dominant seventh harmony, maintaining tension and anticipation without resolution.
