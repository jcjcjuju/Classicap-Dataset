The music begins with a bold, angular theme—originally introduced at the opening—now sounding in a bright, unexpected key that creates a sense of dislocation. Fragments of earlier material return in shifting harmonic colors: a passage featuring triplet rhythms and a sustained harmonic tension reappears, transformed in a new tonal setting. Later, the texture narrows to a single, intense chord—a complex, dissonant cluster that hovers with unresolved tension—while a distinctive rhythmic figure, first heard early in the movement, pulses insistently beneath it, heightening the dramatic urgency before the section dissolves into anticipation.
