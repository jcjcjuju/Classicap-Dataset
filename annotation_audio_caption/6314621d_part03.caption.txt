A lyrical theme, first heard earlier in B flat major, now returns warmly in G major, sounding settled and at home. This is followed by the bold, energetic opening idea of the movement, which reappears with new flourishes and greater length, unfolding with heightened expressiveness. The music then settles into a closing passage that lingers on a steady, grounding G in the bass, over which fragments of melody and harmony gently revolve, creating a sense of calm finality.
