The music opens with a bold, unified theme played in unison, followed by an extended phrase that repeats part of its material, creating a sense of emphasis and expansion. This gives way to a descending cascade of rapid sixteenth-note figures that spiral downward in a stepwise pattern, resolving firmly into a strong, conclusive cadence that establishes a stable tonal center. A transitional passage then emerges, grounded by a sustained bass note that lingers beneath shifting harmonies; it briefly touches on a brighter, related key before returning to the home tonality, building tension through a striking, dissonant chord that resolves into a pause that feels incomplete. The mood then shifts to a more lyrical and graceful theme in a brighter key, introduced in a balanced four-bar phrase that closes with an unexpected harmonic twist. This idea returns in altered form, followed by a rising sequential passage that climbs with gentle insistence before halting on another unresolved cadence over a sustained dominant note. The second half of this contrasting theme begins with a tightly overlapping repetition that compresses the original idea, then unfolds into a responsive phrase that stretches out through sequential echoes and an extended closing gesture, bringing the section to a poised and ornate conclusion.
