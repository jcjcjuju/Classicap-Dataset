A bold, balanced theme unfolds in the home key, first presenting an eight-bar phrase that builds tension with an unresolved pause, then returning with subtle variation to firmly settle the harmony. This entire sixteen-bar idea is immediately played again in full. A new, related theme follows in the brighter dominant key, its melody unfolding in clear sequential patterns that echo the original motif. The music then returns to the home key, restating only the second half of the opening theme—the portion that brings calm resolution—before repeating this entire large section once more.
