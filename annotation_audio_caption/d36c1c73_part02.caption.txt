The music begins with a clear, assertive motive—the opening idea of the main theme—now set over a bright C major chord that quickly shifts to create a sense of tension, as if preparing to move elsewhere. This same motive dominates almost the entire section, constantly reshaped and recontextualized. Briefly, a contrasting lyrical fragment emerges in a somber F minor, recalling a melodic idea from earlier in the movement, but it is soon absorbed back into the persistent reworking of the opening motive. The harmony grows increasingly unsettled, shifting to G minor with the musical lines flipped upside down, then plunging further into the darker, more intense sound of C minor. The section closes with a rich, dissonant chord that hangs in the air—a complex, unstable sonority that strongly pulls toward resolution.
