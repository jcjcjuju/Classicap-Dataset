A somber theme emerges in the alto, establishing a grounded, minor-key character. Soon, a higher voice answers with a closely related melodic idea while the alto weaves a complementary line beneath it, creating a sense of dialogue. A brief transitional passage follows, shifting harmonically before settling back into the original key, where the opening theme returns, now resonating in the bass. A new, freely imitative passage unfolds, introducing fresh rhythmic and melodic motion as the harmony briefly brightens before returning to the darker tonality. Fragments of the main theme appear in the bass and then the treble, each time incomplete and unaccompanied by the earlier counter-melody. Another transitional episode, built from the same material as the first, leads to a full statement of the theme in the alto, immediately followed by a tightly overlapping exchange where the answer appears in the treble while the bass reintroduces the counter-melody. After another short cadential gesture that reaffirms the home key, an inverted version of the answer sounds in the alto, quickly joined by an inverted subject in the bass in close imitation, now colored by a shift to a related minor key. This gives way to further fragmented echoes of the theme in the bass and treble, layered in rapid succession without harmonic support. Later, the texture thins to isolated fragments in alto and inverted bass before building into a final imitative surge: the alto and treble present the theme in quick succession, half a beat apart, while the bass finally reasserts the counter-melody beneath them, restoring a sense of structural clarity.
